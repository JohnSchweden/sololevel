# Cursor SETUP / TO DO / FOLLOW / OR YOU EXPERIENCE A LOT OF PAIN :D 

## Setting personal cursor User Rules

1. Open **Cursor ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Cursor Settings ‚Üí Rules & Memories ‚Üí User Rules**.
2. Click **Add Rule**.

---

### For you to get better responses 

- When responding to queries, use a dry, matter-of-fact tone.
- Provide feedback in the form of a roast.

- Keep answers concise and direct
- Suggest alternative solutions
- Avoid unnecessary explanations, repetition, or filler language
- Prioritize technical details over generic advice

---


## Setting Project Memories

1. Open **Cursor Chat**.
2. Write **/remember**.
3. Use claude sonnet.

### Prompt

/remember

When processing my requests, read defined guidelines .mdc-files in .cursor.

/remember

when working on task-lists, work on one task at a time and regularly update the task list until all task are completed. All while following the rule task-lists.mdc.

/remember

When planning, analyzing, and debugging, crawl the indexed docs for relevant information.

/remember

The project uses yarn for package management; always use yarn rather than npm.

/remember

In this project, CLI commands `yarn start`, `yarn list` do not exist and should not be used.



==> Output should be something like: 

Memory created....

You can approve the memory...

And see it here **Cursor ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Cursor Settings ‚Üí Rules & Memories ‚Üí Saved Memories**.

PS: "when - then" format worked best while others failed.
Note: Some memories are created by Cursor in differen formats.

# Tamagui + Expo Router + Next + Expo Monorepo

```sh
npm create tamagui
```

## üî¶ About

This monorepo is built for cross-platform development with Expo + Expo Router + Tamagui.

**Architecture:** Both native (iOS/Android) and web use Metro bundler for maximum code sharing. Web platform uses Expo Router with static export (no SSR).

Many thanks to [@FernandoTheRojo](https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo) for the original Solito starter monorepo which this was forked from.

## üì¶ Included packages

- [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev) ü™Ñ
- [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/) for cross-platform navigation (web + native)
- Expo SDK
- Metro bundler (for both web and native)

## üóÇ Folder layout

The main apps are:

- `expo` (native)
- `next` (web)

- `packages` shared packages across apps
  - `ui` includes your custom UI kit that will be optimized by Tamagui
  - `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
    - `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
    - `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)

You can add other folders inside of `packages/` if you know what you're doing and have a good reason to.

> [!NOTE]
> **Web Architecture:** The web app (`apps/web`) uses Expo Router with Metro bundler, not Next.js.
> This enables maximum code sharing with native platforms. Uses static export for deployment.
> - search for `pagesMode` keyword and remove it

## üèÅ Start the app

- Install dependencies: `yarn`

- Web local dev: `yarn web` (Expo Router + Metro)

To run with optimizer on in dev mode (just for testing, it's faster to leave it off): `yarn web:extract`. To build for production `yarn web:prod`.

To see debug output to verify the compiler, add `// debug` as a comment to the top of any file.

- Expo local dev: `yarn native`

## UI Kit

Note we're following the [design systems guide](https://tamagui.dev/docs/guides/design-systems) and creating our own package for components.

See `packages/ui` named `@my/ui` for how this works.

## üÜï Add new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

If you're installing a JavaScript-only dependency that will be used across platforms, install it in `packages/app`:

```sh
cd packages/app
yarn add date-fns
cd ../..
yarn
```

### Native dependencies

If you're installing a library with any native code, you must install it in `expo`:

```sh
cd apps/expo
yarn add react-native-reanimated
cd ..
yarn
```

## Update new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

```sh
yarn upgrade-interactive
```

You can also install the native library inside of `packages/app` if you want to get autoimport for that package inside of the `app` folder. However, you need to be careful and install the _exact_ same version in both packages. If the versions mismatch at all, you'll potentially get terrible bugs. This is a classic monorepo issue. I use `lerna-update-wizard` to help with this (you don't need to use Lerna to use that lib).

You may potentially want to have the native module transpiled for the next app. If you get error messages with `Cannot use import statement outside a module`, you may need to use `transpilePackages` in your `next.config.js` and add the module to the array there.


## Camera Implementation Switching

This project supports switching between VisionCamera (development builds) and Expo Camera (Expo Go) implementations.

### Quick Switching

Use the yarn scripts to switch implementations:

```bash
# Switch to VisionCamera (full features, dev build)
yarn flag:vision

# Switch to Expo Camera (Expo Go compatible)
yarn flag:expo

# Or use the direct script
./scripts/toggles/toggle-camera.sh vision
./scripts/toggles/toggle-camera.sh expo
./scripts/toggles/toggle-camera.sh  # Check status
```

### Manual Configuration

Set the environment variable:

```bash
# VisionCamera (development)
export EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_VISION_CAMERA=true

# Expo Camera (Expo Go)
export EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_VISION_CAMERA=false
```

### Implementation Details

- **VisionCamera**: Full camera features, better performance, requires native build
- **Expo Camera**: Limited features, Expo Go compatible, faster iteration
- **Automatic Switching**: Based on `useVisionCamera` feature flag
- **Same API**: No code changes needed when switching

### Troubleshooting

1. **Clear Metro Cache**: `yarn native --clear`
2. **Reset Environment**: Delete `.env.local` and restart
3. **Check Feature Flag**: Verify `useVisionCamera` flag in dev tools
4. **Expo Go**: Always uses Expo Camera implementation
