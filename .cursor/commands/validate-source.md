Validate the completed TDD implementation against all quality criteria and Definition of Done.

**OBJECTIVE:**
The goal is to ensure all implementation aligns with the source document before marking as validated.

**CONTEXT:**
Spec ↔ Impl Conformance
- “Given this spec: [ provided document ]
  and this code/diff: [review code files implemented in this chat],
  list precise mismatches and missing behaviors. For each item: evidence (line refs), user impact, and a minimal fix. Then propose the smallest test that would catch it.”
