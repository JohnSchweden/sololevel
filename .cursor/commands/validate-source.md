Validate the completed TDD implementation against all quality criteria and Definition of Done.

**OBJECTIVE:**
The goal is to ensure all implementation aligns with the source document before marking as validated.

**CONTEXT:**
- Implementation has been completed following the approved task
- All TDD cycles (Red-Green-Refactor) have been executed
- Ready for final validation before deployment

**VALIDATION WORKFLOW:**

**STEP 1: Source Document Validation**
Carefully review and validate all implemented code files against the specified source document:
- Begin by reading each file
- Check for completeness, correctness, and adherence to requirements in the source document
- Identify any discrepancies, omissions, or deviations
- Summarize findings for each file

**VALIDATION REPORT FORMAT:**
üìä Status
- ‚úÖ VALIDATED: All criteria met, ready for deployment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES FOUND: [X] criteria failed, requires fixes
- üöß BLOCKED: [describe blocking issues]

**STOP CONDITIONS:**
Any DoD criteria failures require re-implementation

**REMEMBER:** 
Only mark as VALIDATED when ALL criteria pass. Evidence required for every claim.
