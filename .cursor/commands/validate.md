Validate the completed TDD implementation against all quality criteria and Definition of Done.

**CONTEXT:**
- Implementation has been completed following the approved task
- All TDD cycles (Red-Green-Refactor) have been executed
- Ready for final validation before deployment

**VALIDATION WORKFLOW:**

**STEP 1: Automated Quality Checks**
Run these commands and report exact results:
- `yarn test --verbose` → [Total tests: X, Passed: X, Failed: X]
- `yarn test:coverage` → [Coverage: X%]
- `yarn lint` → [Errors: X, Warnings: X]
- `yarn type-check` → [TypeScript errors: X]

**STEP 2: Definition of Done Verification**
For each DoD criterion:
- [ ] [Criterion] - ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL - [Evidence/Details]
- [ ] [Criterion] - ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL - [Evidence/Details]

**STEP 3: Implementation Quality Assessment**
- [ ] All tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- [ ] No hardcoded values or magic numbers
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented
- [ ] Code follows project patterns and conventions

**STEP 4: Performance Validation**
- [ ] Bundle size impact acceptable
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Loading times within acceptable range
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified

**VALIDATION REPORT FORMAT:**
🧪 Test Results
- Command: [exact command run]
- Total tests: [number]
- Passed: [number]
- Failed: [number]
- Failed test names: [list OR "none"]

🔍 Code Quality
- Lint errors: [number]
- TypeScript errors: [number]
- Issues: [list with file:line OR "none"]

📊 Status
- ✅ VALIDATED: All criteria met, ready for deployment
- ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND: [X] criteria failed, requires fixes
- 🚧 BLOCKED: [describe blocking issues]

**STOP CONDITIONS:**
- Any test failures must be resolved
- Any linting/TypeScript errors must be fixed
- Any DoD criteria failures require re-implementation

**REMEMBER:**
Only mark as VALIDATED when ALL criteria pass. Evidence required for every claim.
