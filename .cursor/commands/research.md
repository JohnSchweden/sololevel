Analyze our monorepo architecture and identify mobile development improvements.

CONTEXT:
- Read @monorepo-foundation.mdc and @architecture.mermaid
- Research @Web for modern best practices (2024-2025)
- Focus on practices that directly impact our tech stack (Expo-RN/Next.js, Tamagui, Supabase)

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
Evaluate each practice against our specific constraints:
- Cross-platform compatibility (React Native + Web)
- Monorepo architecture (Yarn 4 workspaces)
- AI pipeline requirements (pose detection, video analysis)
- Performance budgets (250KB web bundle limit)

DELIVERABLE:
Return findings as prioritized recommendations:

**HIGH IMPACT, LOW EFFORT** (Implement First)
1. [Practice] - [Specific benefit to our codebase]
2. Implementation steps (2-3 concrete actions)
3. Expected outcome (measurable metric)

**HIGH IMPACT, HIGH EFFORT** (Plan for Later)
1. [Practice] - [Strategic value]
2. Prerequisites and dependencies
3. Implementation timeline estimate

**MEDIUM IMPACT** (Consider if Time Permits)
1. [Practice] - [Incremental benefit]
2. Quick wins within this category

EXCLUDE:
- Practices incompatible with React Native
- Tools that conflict with our Yarn 4 setup
- Patterns that don't align with our AI coaching domain

REMEMBER: Prioritize by impact-to-effort ratio AND alignment with our specific architecture constraints.

**DO NOT WRITE ANY CODE!**
