Implement with real-time progress tracking and quality gates following TDD.

CONTEXT:
- Follow TDD methodology strictly (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Track progress against Definition of Done criteria

EXECUTION WORKFLOW:

**STEP 1: Pre-Execution Validation**
- [ ] Confirm plan is still valid
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are available
- [ ] Set up test environment

**STEP 2: TDD Cycle Execution**
For each test case:
1. Write failing test (RED)
2. Implement minimal code to pass (GREEN)
3. Refactor while keeping tests green (REFACTOR)
4. Update progress tracker

**STEP 3: Quality Gates**
After each phase:
- [ ] Run test suite: `yarn test --verbose`
- [ ] Check coverage: `yarn test:coverage`
- [ ] Lint check: `yarn lint`
- [ ] Type check: `yarn type-check`

**PROGRESS REPORTING:**
After each completed item, report:
- ‚úÖ [Item] - [Time taken] - [Tests added: X]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è [Blockers] - [Resolution needed]
- üìä [Coverage: X%] - [Lint errors: X] - [TS errors: X]

**STOP CONDITIONS:**
- Halt if any quality gate fails
- Halt if implementation deviates from plan
- Halt if new requirements discovered

**COMPLETION CRITERIA:**
- [ ] All phases completed
- [ ] All DoD criteria met
- [ ] Final quality report generated

REMEMBER: Execute exactly as planned. Any deviations require re-approval before continuing.
