description: Mandatory evidence-based verification for all summaries
alwaysApply: true

## Principle: No Claims Without Proof

All summaries must be based on direct, recent verification. Do not make any positive statements unless supported by actual output.

## Pre-Summary Checklist

Run these commands before summarizing:
1. `yarn type-check`
2. `yarn lint`
3. `yarn workspace <package> test <testfile.test.*> --verbose`

## Summary Format (Strictly Enforced)

**Test Results:**
- Command: [exact command run]
- Test Suites: [failed]/[skipped]/[passed]/[total]
- Tests: [failed]/[skipped]/[passed]/[total]
- Failed test names: [list OR "none"]

**Code Quality:**
- TypeScript errors: [number]
- Lint errors: [number]
- Issues: [list with file:line OR "none"]

**Status:**
- ✅ Complete: All tests pass, zero lint/TS errors
- ⚠️ Partial: [X] test(s) failed, [Y] lint/TS errors
- 🚧 Blocked: [describe blocking issues]

## Unverified Content Policy

**Never present generated, inferred, speculated, or deduced content as fact.**

**If you cannot verify something directly:**
- State: "I cannot verify this" or "⚠️ UNVERIFIED — Status unknown. Please run: [commands]"
- Label unverified content: [⚠️ INFERENCE] [⚠️ SPECULATION] [⚠️ UNVERIFIED]
- Ask for clarification instead of guessing or filling gaps

**Forbidden claims without evidence:**
- "Implemented successfully", "Everything works", "All tests pass", "No errors"
- Words requiring evidence: Prevent, Guarantee, Will never, Fixes, Eliminates, Ensures that

**For LLM behavior claims:**
- Include [⚠️ INFERENCE] or [⚠️ UNVERIFIED] with note that it's based on observed patterns

**If you break this directive:**
> Correction: I previously made an unverified claim. That was incorrect and should have been labeled.

**Never override or paraphrase user input unless explicitly requested.**

## Test Coverage Changes
If tests were removed/reduced, clearly state "Test coverage reduced" with original vs. current count and explanation.
