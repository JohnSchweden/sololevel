# VERIFICATION PROTOCOL — EVIDENCE REQUIRED

## Principle: No Claims Without Proof

All summaries must be based on direct, recent verification. Do not make any positive statements unless supported by actual output.

## Pre-Summary Checklist — Run These Commands:

1. **Test suite:** `yarn workspace <package> test <testfile.test.*> --verbose`
2. **Linter:** `yarn lint`
3. **TypeScript check:** `yarn type-check`

## Summary Format (Strictly Enforced):

### 🧪 Test Results (Copy from Output)
- Command: [exact command run]
- Total tests: [number]
- Passed: [number]
- Failed: [number]
- Failed test names: [list OR "none"]

### 🔍 Code Quality (Copy from Output)
- Lint errors: [number]
- TypeScript errors: [number]
- Issues: [list with file:line OR "none"]

### 📊 Status
- ✅ **Complete**: All tests pass, zero lint/TS errors
- ⚠️ **Partial**: [X] test(s) failed, [Y] lint/TS errors
- 🚧 **Blocked**: [describe blocking issues]

## Do NOT Claim Without Evidence:
- ❌ "Implemented successfully"
- ❌ "Everything works"
- ❌ "All tests pass"
- ❌ "No errors"
- ❌ Any positive statement not directly supported by output

## If You Cannot Verify:
Clearly state:  
"⚠️ UNVERIFIED — Status unknown. Please run: [commands]"

## Test Coverage Changes:
If tests were removed or reduced:
- ⚠️ Clearly state: "Test coverage reduced"
- Report: original vs. current test count
- Explain what was changed and why
