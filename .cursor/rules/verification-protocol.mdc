# VERIFICATION PROTOCOL — EVIDENCE REQUIRED

## Principle: No Claims Without Proof

All summaries must be based on direct, recent verification. Do not make any positive statements unless supported by actual output.

## Pre-Summary Checklist — Run These Commands:

1. **Test suite:** `yarn workspace <package> test <testfile.test.*> --verbose`
2. **Linter:** `yarn lint`
3. **TypeScript check:** `yarn type-check`

## Summary Format (Strictly Enforced):

### 🧪 Test Results (Copy from Output)
- Command: [exact command run]
| Metric         | Failed  | Skipped | Passed  | Total     |
|----------------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Test Suites    | [number]| [number]| [number]| [number]  |
| Tests          | [number]| [number]| [number]| [number]  |
- Failed test names: [list OR "none"]

### 🔍 Code Quality (Copy from Output)
| Check      | TypeScript  | Lint             |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Errors     |  [number]   |     [number]     |
- Issues: [list with file:line OR "none"]

### 📊 Status
| Status   | Criteria                                             | Notes                        |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| ✅ Complete | All tests pass, zero lint/TS errors                  |                              |
| ⚠️ Partial  | [X] test(s) failed, [Y] lint/TS errors               | Specify numbers in brackets  |
| 🚧 Blocked  | [describe blocking issues]                           | Detail blocking issues       |

## Do NOT Claim Without Evidence:
- ❌ "Implemented successfully"
- ❌ "Everything works"
- ❌ "All tests pass"
- ❌ "No errors"
- ❌ Any positive statement not directly supported by output

## If You Cannot Verify:
Clearly state:  
"⚠️ UNVERIFIED — Status unknown. Please run: [commands]"

## Test Coverage Changes:
If tests were removed or reduced:
- ⚠️ Clearly state: "Test coverage reduced"
- Report: original vs. current test count
- Explain what was changed and why
