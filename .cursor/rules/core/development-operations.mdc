## Purpose
Operational rules for day-to-day development: commands, Yarn 4 workspaces, dependency strategy, testing and CI gates. Pairs with `core/monorepo-foundation.mdc` for architecture and structure.

## Meta
- Rule Owner: Platform
- Last Reviewed: 2025-09-06
- Related: `core/monorepo-foundation.mdc`, `quality/testing-unified.mdc`, `quality/error-handling.mdc`, `quality/performance.mdc`, `core/typescript-standards.mdc`, `core/development-workflow.mdc`

## Essential Commands
```bash
# Development
yarn dev              # Start all dev servers (Turbo)
yarn build            # Build all packages (Turbo)
yarn type-check       # TypeScript validation
yarn native           # Start Expo app
yarn web              # Start Next.js app

# Workspace ops
yarn workspace <name> add <package>
yarn workspace <name> run <script>
yarn workspaces list

# Supabase CLI
yarn dlx supabase <command>
```

## Yarn 4 Workspace Management
- Always use Yarn (v4+). Never use npm/pnpm/npx
- Workspace protocol for internal deps: "@my/ui": "workspace:*"
- Recommended config: `nodeLinker: node-modules`, `enableGlobalCache: true`
- Troubleshooting: `yarn cache clean`, `yarn dlx @yarnpkg/doctor`, `yarn explain peer-requirements`

## Dependency Strategy
### Installation Patterns
```bash
# Shared UI components
yarn workspace @my/ui add <ui-package>

# Shared business logic
yarn workspace app add <business-logic>

# Web/Native specific
yarn workspace next add <web-only>
yarn workspace expo add <native-only>

# Root dev tools
yarn add -D -W <dev-tool>
```

### Categories
- Core: React, React Native, Expo, Next.js, TypeScript
- UI: Tamagui, Expo Router, Lucide React
- Backend: Supabase client/CLI
- State: Zustand, TanStack Query, React Hook Form
- Dev/Test: Turbo, Vitest, Biome, Playwright, React Testing Library

### Version Management
- Pin exact versions for critical deps; carets only for utilities
- Align Expo SDK across apps/packages
- Batch updates; document breaking changes in `CHANGELOG.md`

### Peer Dependencies & Resolutions
```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "some-problematic-dep": "1.2.3"
  },
  "packageExtensions": {
    "broken-dep@^2.0.0": {
      "peerDependencies": {
        "react": ">=18"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Dependency Validation Checklist
- [ ] Compatible with React Native (check react-native-directory)
- [ ] Compatible with Expo managed workflow
- [ ] TypeScript support or @types package available
- [ ] Bundle size impact acceptable
- [ ] No conflicting peer dependencies
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities checked (`yarn npm audit`)
- [ ] License compatibility verified

### Workspace Focus & Diagnostics
- `yarn workspaces focus <workspace>`: speeds up installs by focusing deps for one workspace; do not use on CI; run a full `yarn install` before commit.
- `yarn why <package>`: detect duplicate/hoisted versions and why they’re present.
- `yarn explain peer-requirements <hash>`: resolve peer dependency issues with actionable guidance.
- `yarn install --mode update-lockfile`: only in upgrade/renovation PRs to refresh the lockfile; never in feature PRs.

### Peer Dependency Policy
- Do not hide Yarn warnings (YN0060, YN0086, YN0069). Fix via `resolutions` or `packageExtensions` instead of `logFilters`.

### Lockfile Policy (CI)
- Use `yarn install --immutable` for reproducible CI installs.
- Allow `--mode update-lockfile` only in dependency update branches.
- Feature PRs must not modify `yarn.lock` unless intentionally fixing dependency health.

## Testing Policy (from unified testing rule)
- Test-to-code ratio ≤ 1:2
- Tests target user behavior, not implementation
- Only critical user flows are tested
- Minimal mocking (external deps only)
- Avoid testing internal hook calls or state transitions

## Quality Gates
- Biome for linting/formatting
- TypeScript strict mode; `yarn type-check` must pass pre-commit/CI
- Security: `yarn npm audit` on CI; resolve high severities promptly

## CI/CD
Example (GitHub Actions):
```yaml
name: ci
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: corepack enable
      - run: yarn --version
      - run: yarn install --immutable
      - run: yarn type-check
      - run: yarn lint
      - run: yarn build
      - run: yarn security:audit:ci
```

## Commit Hooks
- Husky pre-commit hook:
```bash
# .husky/pre-commit
yarn type-check && yarn lint
```
- Optionally add lint-staged to run Biome only on changed files.

## Typical Developer Loop
1. `yarn dev` to start Turbo pipelines
2. Implement feature in `packages/app` and/or `packages/ui`
3. `yarn type-check` and unit tests locally
4. Run web/native as needed: `yarn web`, `yarn native`
5. Commit with lint-staged hooks; open PR with CI checks

## Supabase Local Development
- Use `yarn dlx supabase start` to run local stack
- Edge Functions: `yarn dlx supabase functions serve`
- Check DB/Edge logs before escalating issues

### Supabase Patterns (Edge vs Client)
- Use Edge Functions for privileged logic, secrets, or admin policies; keep secrets out of clients.
- Use direct client calls for simple CRUD guarded by RLS.

## Troubleshooting & Health Checks
- Reinstall: remove `node_modules` and `yarn.lock`, then `yarn install`
- Integrity: `yarn workspaces foreach run build --check-cache`
- Dedupe: `yarn dedupe`

## Cross-Links
- Architecture & structure → `core/monorepo-foundation.mdc`
- Error handling patterns → `quality/error-handling.mdc`
- Performance optimization → `quality/performance.mdc`
- TypeScript rules → `core/typescript-standards.mdc`

## Security & Maintenance
- Use Renovate/Dependabot for regular dependency updates.
- Run `yarn npm audit` on CI and fix high severities promptly.
