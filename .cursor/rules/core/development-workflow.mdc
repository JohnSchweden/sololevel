# Development Workflow Rules

## Building and Running
- Use Turbo for build orchestration: `yarn build` (runs `turbo build`)
- Dev server: `yarn dev` (runs `turbo dev`)
- Mobile: `yarn workspace expo-app start` or `yarn native`
- Web: `yarn workspace next-app dev` or `yarn web`

## Code Quality
- Always run TypeScript checks: `yarn type-check`
- Use Biome for linting and formatting
- Validate commits with lint-staged if configured

## Test Review Checklist
- [ ] Test-to-code ratio is ≤ 1:2
- [ ] Tests focus on user behavior, not implementation
- [ ] Only critical user flows are tested
- [ ] Minimal mocking (only external dependencies)
- [ ] No testing of internal hook calls or state changes
