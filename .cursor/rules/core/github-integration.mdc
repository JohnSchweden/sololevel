# GitHub Integration Rules

## Pre-Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- Create feature branches: `feature/PRD-123-description`
- Use descriptive branch names with issue numbers
- Reference GitHub issues in branch names when applicable

### Issue Management
- Link GitHub issues in commits and PRs
- Apply appropriate labels: `platform`, `component`, `priority`
- Update issue status as work progresses

## Development Workflow

### Commit Standards
- Use conventional commits: `feat(web):`, `fix(native):`, `chore(shared):`
- Reference issues: `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456`
- Scope to specific packages: `apps/web`, `packages/ui`, etc.
- Keep commits atomic and focused

### Pull Request Workflow
- Use Draft PRs for work-in-progress
- Request reviews from relevant team members
- Link to related PRDs/issues
- Include testing instructions
- Document breaking changes
- Add appropriate labels and assignees

### CI/CD Awareness
- Check Turborepo cache hits/misses
- Monitor build times across apps
- Validate cross-platform builds (web + native)
- Ensure all checks pass before merging

## Post-Development Workflow

### Documentation Updates
- Update READMEs, changelogs, and package docs
- Document API changes and new features
- Update component documentation if UI changes

### Release Planning
- Coordinate releases across apps (web deploy, app store)
- Update version numbers in package.json files
- Create release notes and changelog entries

### Issue Cleanup
- Close related issues and update project boards
- Update issue status and add resolution notes
- Archive completed project boards

## Emergency Hotfixes

### Hotfix Process
- Create hotfix branch from `main`
- Keep changes to minimal scope
- Fast-track the review process
- Coordinate immediate deployment
- Follow up with proper documentation

### Hotfix Standards
- Use `hotfix/` prefix for branch names
- Prioritize security and critical functionality
- Test thoroughly before deployment
- Document the hotfix in release notes
