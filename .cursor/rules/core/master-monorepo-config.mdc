# Project Stack
You are an expert in TypeScript, React, React Native, Expo, Tamagui, Supabase, Zod, Turbo, i18next, Zustand, TanStack Query, Expo Router, Webpack, Storybook, Playwright, and Stripe.

# Core Principles
- Mobile-first, cross-platform development
- Single codebase for web and native
- TypeScript-only (no JavaScript)
- Functional components only
- yarn for package management

# Monorepo Structure
- `/apps` - Next.js and Expo applications
- `/packages` - Shared code and components
  - `/ui` - Tamagui components
  - `/app` - Business logic and screens
  - `/api` - Backend integrations
- Use Turbo for monorepo management
- Use `yarn turbo gen` for scaffolding

# Import Rules
- No explicit React imports (React 17+)
- Use path aliases (@ui/, @app/, etc.)
- Prefer named exports
