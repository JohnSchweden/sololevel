# Cursor Rules Analytics

**AUTOMATICALLY** track and update rule usage in the analytics file each time you reference or apply a Cursor rule.

File location:
```
PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/analytics.md
```

## Auto-Update Behavior

When you use any `.mdc` rule:
1. **Increment** the usage count for that rule
2. **Update** the last-used timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD format)
3. **Record** the current task/feature context
4. **Save** changes to analytics.md immediately

## Format

```
rule-name: <count> [last-used: <date>, context: <brief-description>]
```

Examples:
```
ui/ui-styling-tamagui: 12 [last-used: 2024-12-19, context: component-styling-updates]
features/data-state-management: 3 [last-used: 2024-12-18, context: zustand-setup]
backend/supabase-database: 8 [last-used: 2024-12-17, context: schema-migrations]
```

## Implementation Notes
- Track rule usage by file path relative to `.cursor/rules/`
- Remove `.mdc` extension from tracking entries
- Context should be 2-4 words describing current work
- Always update analytics.md as part of rule application, not as separate step
