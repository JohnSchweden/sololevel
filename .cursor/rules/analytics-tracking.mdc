# Rule Usage Analytics

Track and update rule usage automatically in `.cursor/analytics.md`.

## Format
```
rule-name: <count> [last-used: YYYY-MM-DD, context: <brief-description>]
```

## Auto-Update Process
1. **Increment** usage count
2. **Update** timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. **Record** context (2-4 words)
4. **Save** immediately

## Examples
```
core/monorepo-foundation: 5 [last-used: 2025-09-06, context: rules-consolidation]
core/development-operations: 7 [last-used: 2025-09-06, context: rules-consolidation]
quality/testing-unified: 3 [last-used: 2025-09-06, context: test-setup]
```

## Rules
- Use file path relative to `.cursor/rules/` (no `.mdc` extension)
- Update as part of rule application, not separately
- Context describes current work focus
