# Baseline Tracking Guidelines

## Before Starting Any Implementation Task

### 1. Record the Current State
Execute and save the outputs of:
- `yarn workspace <package> test <testfile.test.*> --verbose`
- `yarn lint`

### 2. Establish Baseline Metrics
Note the following from the initial outputs:
- Number of passing tests
- Number of failing tests
- Number of lint errors

### 3. Post-Implementation Comparison
In your final summary, you MUST report:
- Test changes: e.g., "+X tests added, -Y tests removed"
- Lint changes: e.g., "+X new lint errors, -Y resolved"
- Any decrease in test coverage must be clearly flagged as: ⚠️ WARNING

## Handling Test Coverage Reductions
If you remove or simplify tests:
- You MUST state: "⚠️ Test coverage reduced"
- You MUST specify which tests were removed and provide a rationale
- You MUST acknowledge this as a regression from the original plan
