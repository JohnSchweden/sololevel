# Testing Philosophy & Guidelines

## Core Principle
Start with the simplest possible tests that verify component behavior. Focus on user interactions and props, not DOM structure.

## Mandatory Pre-Test Checklist
- Read existing test patterns in the codebase first
- Review user's testing rules (1:2 ratio, behavior-focused)
- Check what the mock system is designed for
- Start with the SIMPLEST possible test that verifies component works
- Focus on USER BEHAVIOR, not DOM structure
- Write maximum 2-3 tests initially, not 6+

## Red Flags to Stop and Reassess
- Using getByText with complex regex patterns
- Using querySelector or getAllByRole
- Testing DOM structure instead of behavior
- Writing more than 3 tests initially
- Fighting with mock system instead of working with it
- Testing implementation details

## Escalation Rule
If struggling with tests for more than 2 attempts:
1. STOP writing complex tests
2. GO BACK to the template above
3. ASK user for guidance on the specific issue
4. DO NOT keep trying different approaches

## Ratio & Scope Rules
- **1:2 test-to-code ratio** (1 line of test per 2 lines of code)
- Never exceed 1:1 ratio
- Focus on user-visible behavior and interactions
- Test critical user flows only
- Mock only external dependencies
- Avoid testing every state combination or edge case
- If test code exceeds component code, you're testing the wrong things

## Enforcement
- This rule applies to ALL test files and testing activities
- Follow the pre-test checklist before writing any tests
- Escalate immediately if hitting red flags or struggling
- Maintain the 1:2 ratio strictly - it's non-negotiable
