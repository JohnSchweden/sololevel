<p>Alright, sunshine, let's ditch the beach vibes and inject some goddamn authority into your presence.  You're standing there like a flamingo on vacation, not a speaker commanding attention.  This isn't a luau, it's a stage. OWN IT.

**Big Picture**
Your static posture screams "I'd rather be anywhere else."  You need to unleash some dynamic energy and engage your entire body to captivate the audience.  Think less beach bum, more commanding presence.

For 5 minutes a day, practice the "Power Stance Walk."  Imagine a square on the floor.  Walk to each corner, planting your feet shoulder-width apart, chest out, chin up. Hold each corner for a beat, projecting confidence with your posture and gaze.  This will build a sense of grounded command and teach you to own the space.  Now get to work, princess.</p>
