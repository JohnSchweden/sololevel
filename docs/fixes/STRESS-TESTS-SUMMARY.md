## Key Test Patterns

### Pattern 1: Rapid Prop Updates
```typescript
for (let progress = 0; progress <= 1.0; progress += 0.05) {
  rerender(<VideoControls collapseProgress={progress} />)
  await act(async () => await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 5)))
}
expect(screen.getByTestId('video-controls-container')).toBeInTheDocument()
```

### Pattern 2: Long Session Simulation
```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  const simulatedSeconds = (i / 100) * 780  // 13 minutes
  rerender(<VideoControls currentTime={simulatedSeconds % 120} />)
}
```

### Pattern 3: Mount/Unmount During Animation
```typescript
const { unmount, rerender } = render(<VideoControls collapseProgress={0} />)
rerender(<VideoControls collapseProgress={0.5} />)
expect(() => unmount()).not.toThrow()  // Critical test
```

### Pattern 4: Edge Case Testing
```typescript
const extremeValues = [-1000, NaN, Infinity, 1000]
for (const value of extremeValues) {
  const { unmount } = render(<VideoControls collapseProgress={value} />)
  expect(screen.getByTestId('video-controls-container')).toBeInTheDocument()
  unmount()
}
```

---

## Test Maintenance

### When Adding New Features
1. Identify interactions with Reanimated/animations
2. Add corresponding stress test
3. Test rapid prop changes + mount/unmount
4. Verify memory cleanup

### When Refactoring
1. Ensure all 36 stress tests still pass
2. Don't remove tests - only add to coverage
3. Update test descriptions if logic changes
4. Run tests 10x to catch flaky behavior

### When Updating Dependencies
1. Run stress tests with new version
2. Verify no new warnings
3. Check for memory leaks
4. Validate performance metrics
