# Stress Test Guide - Reanimated Crash Regression Prevention

**Purpose:** Document and execute comprehensive stress tests to prevent regression of the critical Reanimated memory corruption crash (folly::dynamic SIGSEGV).

**Status:** ✅ Complete - 40+ stress tests implemented across 2 files

---

## Overview

### What Was Fixed

The app crashed with `EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)` in `folly::dynamic::type()` during shadow tree cloning. Root causes:

1. **Shared values not cleaned up on unmount** → dangling references
2. **JS value used in worklets** → race condition
3. **Circular callback references** → stale closures
4. **Deep component nesting** → excessive recursion

### How Stress Tests Prevent Regression

Stress tests simulate:
- ✅ Rapid prop changes (mode transitions)
- ✅ Long sessions (13+ minutes of continuous updates)
- ✅ Mount/unmount cycles
- ✅ Extreme/edge case values
- ✅ Reanimated-specific warnings
- ✅ Memory cleanup verification

## Running the Stress Tests

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all VideoControls stress tests
yarn workspace @my/ui test VideoControls.test.tsx --testNamePattern="Stress Tests"

# Run all animation hook stress tests
yarn workspace @my/ui test useProgressBarAnimation.test.ts --testNamePattern="Stress Tests"

# Run EVERYTHING
yarn workspace @my/ui test --testNamePattern="Stress Tests|Regression Prevention"
```

### Verbose Output

```bash
# See detailed test execution
yarn workspace @my/ui test VideoControls.test.tsx --verbose --testNamePattern="Stress Tests"

# With coverage
yarn workspace @my/ui test --coverage --testNamePattern="Stress Tests"
```

### Watch Mode (Development)

```bash
# Auto-rerun tests on file changes
yarn workspace @my/ui test --watch VideoControls.test.tsx --testNamePattern="Stress Tests"
```

### 2. Long Session (13+ Minutes)
- Continuous prop updates (100 iterations)
- Simulated playback progress every 0.1 seconds
- Oscillating collapse progress
- Total simulated time: 780 seconds (13 minutes)

### 3. Mount/Unmount Cycles
- 10 mount/unmount cycles
- Unmount during active animation
- Unmount while props changing simultaneously
- Cleanup verification

### 4. Edge Cases
- Extreme collapse progress values (-1000 to 1000)
- NaN and Infinity values
- Rapid play/pause switching (50x)

### 5. Complex Scenarios
- Mock gestures during rapid prop changes
- Render count tracking
- Memory cleanup verification
- Reanimated worklet warning detection
