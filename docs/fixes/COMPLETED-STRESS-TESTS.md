## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Caused the Crash
1. **Shared values not cleaned up** on unmount
2. **JS values used in worklets** (race condition)
3. **Circular callback references** (stale closures)
4. **Deep component nesting** (17+ levels)

### What Tests Verify
1. ✅ Rapid prop changes handled safely
2. ✅ Long sessions don't leak memory
3. ✅ Mount/unmount cleans up properly
4. ✅ Edge cases don't crash
5. ✅ Worklets don't warn
6. ✅ Shared values lifecycle correct
7. ✅ Deep recursion doesn't occur

### Best Practices Established
1. Always cleanup shared values on unmount
2. Use shared values for worklet dependencies
3. Avoid circular refs via callbacks
4. Test unmount during animation
5. Monitor memory in long sessions
6. Test edge cases comprehensively
