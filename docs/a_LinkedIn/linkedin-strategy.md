### Post 1: Building SoloLevel with AI Workflows

**Hook:**
1,860 AI interactions in 4 days. 305 tool calls in 3 hours. Here's what I learned building an AI feedback app with AI assistance.

**Body:**
I looked at my Cursor chat history from October and the numbers tell a story.

87 search/replace operations. 67 file reads. 65 terminal commands. 36 codebase searches. All in one session.

This isn't about using AI to write code. It's about architecting workflows where AI handles the repetitive stuff so I can focus on the hard problems. The AI reads files, searches codebases, runs terminal commands. I make decisions, design architecture, solve problems.

I'm building SoloLevel, an AI feedback coach app. Users record videos and get AI-powered coaching on their performance. The meta part? I'm using AI to build it.

The workflow is simple but powerful:
- AI explores the codebase when I need context
- AI refactors code systematically when I need consistency
- AI runs commands when I need automation
- I design features, solve problems, and make calls

There's a learning curve. You need to trust the AI enough to let it work, but verify everything it does. You need to prompt effectively. You need to think about your workflow differently.

But once it clicks, you move faster than you thought possible.

I'm not a developer anymore. I'm an AI workflow architect. I design systems where AI amplifies human capability instead of replacing it.

Who else is building AI-first workflows? What's working for you?

### Post 2: The AI Transformation Journey

**Hook:**
6 months ago, I thought AI coding assistants were just fancy autocomplete. Today, I can't imagine building software without them. Here's the honest truth about my transformation.

**Body:**
I started as a skeptic. "AI will never understand my codebase," I said.

Reality hit me hard. AI became my most reliable pair programming partner. I learned to think in AI-first workflows. I realized AI isn't replacing me—it's making me superhuman.

In October alone, my AI assistant helped me execute 1,860+ development operations. 28.5% of my time went to systematic refactoring. 22% to context gathering. 21.3% to automation. The AI does the work. I do the thinking.

This changes how you build software. You stop being a developer and start being a workflow architect. You design systems, not just code.

The learning curve is real. You need new mental models. You need to trust but verify. You need to prompt effectively.

But the payoff is worth it. I'm building faster, with higher quality, than I ever could alone.

The future isn't AI replacing developers. It's developers who learn to architect AI-first workflows replacing everyone else.

### Post 3: The Future of AI-First Development

**Hook:**
My AI assistant made 305 tool calls in 3 hours. Some developers call this overkill. I call it the future of software development.

**Body:**
Let me show you what this actually looks like.

In October alone, my AI helped me execute 1,860+ development operations. 28.5% of my time went to systematic code refactoring. 22% to context gathering and file analysis. 21.3% to terminal operations and automation.

I'm building SoloLevel—an AI feedback coach app that helps users improve through video analysis. The irony? I'm using AI to build AI-powered software.

My workflow looks like this:
- AI explores the codebase when I need context
- AI refactors code systematically when I need consistency
- AI runs commands when I need automation
- I design features, solve problems, and make calls

The developers who will thrive in the AI era aren't those who fear replacement. They're those who learn to architect AI-first development processes.

The future of software development isn't human vs. AI. It's human + AI, working together.

What's your take? Are you building AI-first workflows, or still figuring out the optimal approach?

## Ready-to-Post: October 2025 Analysis

### Post: Building SoloLevel with AI

### Alternative: The Meta Story

**Hook:**
I'm using AI to build an AI app. Here's what 1,860 AI interactions taught me about workflow design.

**Body:**
SoloLevel is an AI feedback coach app. Users record videos, AI analyzes them, users get coaching.

I'm building it with Cursor, an AI coding assistant. 305 tool calls in 3 hours. 1,860 interactions across 4 days.

The irony isn't lost on me.

What I discovered: The AI doesn't write my code. It handles everything else. File reads, code searches, refactoring, terminal commands. I focus on architecture, problem-solving, and decisions.

28.5% of my time goes to systematic refactoring. 22% to context gathering. 21.3% to automation. The AI does the work. I do the thinking.

This changes how you build software. You stop being a developer and start being a workflow architect. You design systems, not just code.

The learning curve is real. You need new mental models. You need to trust but verify. You need to prompt effectively.

But the payoff is worth it. I'm building faster, with higher quality, than I ever could alone.

The future isn't AI replacing developers. It's developers who learn to architect AI-first workflows replacing everyone else.

Are you building AI-first workflows? What's your approach?

### Here’s a clean October 1 LinkedIn post draft you can paste now:

Title: 1,860 AI interactions later, here’s what changed

I reviewed my Cursor chat history from October 1. The numbers were clear.

- 305 tool calls in 3 hours
- 87 search/replace runs
- 67 file reads
- 65 terminal commands
- 36 codebase searches

I’m not asking AI to “write code.” I’m designing a workflow where AI handles the repetitive layers so I can focus on decisions, architecture, and outcomes.

Project: SoloLevel, an AI feedback coach. Users record video; the system analyzes and coaches. The meta bit: I’m using AI to build it.

What works:
- AI explores code when I need context
- AI applies refactors with consistency
- AI runs commands on demand
- I own the calls, scope, and tradeoffs

What changed:
- I stopped acting like a developer
- I started acting like an AI workflow architect
- Velocity went up; context loss went down

This isn’t hype. It’s operations. Build systems; let AI do the heavy lifting; keep judgment human.

Are you building AI-first workflows? What did you cut, and what did you keep?
