## TDD Implementation Notes
- **Test-First Approach**: Always write failing tests before implementation
- **User Behavior Focus**: Test what users do, not how components work internally
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Follow strict TDD cycle for all components
- **Test-to-Code Ratio**: Maintain 1:2 maximum (1 line test per 2 lines code)
- **Analysis Reference**: Always validate implementation against docs/features/[feature-name]/analysis.md
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Design for smallest screen first, expand to larger screens
- **Device Testing**: Test on actual devices, not just simulators
- **Offline Considerations**: Consider offline functionality for mobile users
- **One-Handed Usage**: Optimize for one-handed mobile usage patterns
- **Cross-Platform Validation**: Ensure feature parity while respecting platform conventions

## TDD Analysis Integration
- **Test-Driven Analysis**: Write tests based on wireframe analysis requirements
- **Component Mapping**: Use analysis to define test cases for component behavior
- **Technical Requirements**: Validate test coverage against analysis documentation
- **Iterative Updates**: Update analysis file if requirements change during TDD cycles
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Use analysis as source of truth for test-driven acceptance criteria
