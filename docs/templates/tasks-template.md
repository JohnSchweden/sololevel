- [ ] Storybook interaction testing
- [ ] Visual regression testing

### Integration Testing  
- [ ] Screen tests: `packages/app/features/ScreenName/*.test.tsx`
- [ ] Data layer integration tests
- [ ] Navigation flow tests

### End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Native E2E: `e2e/ScreenName.test.ts` (Detox)

## Cross-Platform Validation Checklist
- [ ] Visual parity between web and native
- [ ] Interaction behavior consistency
- [ ] Performance parity (load times, animations)
- [ ] Accessibility feature parity
- [ ] Navigation integration works on both platforms

## Implementation Notes
- **Analysis Reference**: Always validate implementation against docs/features/[feature-name]/analysis.md
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Design for smallest screen first, expand to larger screens
- **Device Testing**: Test on actual devices, not just simulators
- **Offline Considerations**: Consider offline functionality for mobile users
- **One-Handed Usage**: Optimize for one-handed mobile usage patterns
- **Cross-Platform Validation**: Ensure feature parity while respecting platform conventions

## Analysis Integration
- Reference wireframe analysis for component mapping decisions
- Validate technical requirements against analysis documentation
- Update analysis file if requirements change during implementation
- Use analysis as source of truth for acceptance criteria validation
