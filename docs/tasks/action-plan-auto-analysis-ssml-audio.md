### Auto Analysis + SSML/Audio Segments Action Plan

Purpose: Backend-driven, reliable kickoff of video analysis and per-feedback SSML/audio generation. Remove summary-level audio, split SSML and audio into separate segment tables, add queues and triggers, and wire Edge Functions accordingly.

---

### Goals
- Analysis starts automatically when a video upload finishes (no client call).
- SSML is generated per feedback item; audio is generated from SSML.
- No summary-level audio; artifacts are per-feedback segments only.
- All work is queued, idempotent, and observable with statuses.

---

### Three-Phase Implementation Plan

#### Phase 0 · Discovery & Guardrails (Prep)
- Inventory current schema, triggers, policies, Edge functions, and client dependencies that touch SSML/audio; capture discrepancies (duplicate fields, legacy jobs).
- Freeze new migrations affecting analysis/feedback until cleanup plan approved; define rollback points and backups.
- Update `docs/spec/status.md` and `docs/tasks` with scope, ownership, risks, and checkpoints; confirm analytics logging for rule usage.
- **Discovery Findings (2025-09-25)**
  - Pre-cleanup references to `analysis_jobs.audio_url`, `audio_format`, and `audio_duration_ms` were located across migrations, Supabase functions, Edge workers, and API/config types.
  - Identified legacy RPC signatures (`store_analysis_results`, `store_analysis_audio_segment`, `store_audio_segment`, `get_analysis_with_metrics`, `get_audio_segments_for_feedback`) that still accepted SSML/audio payloads.
  - Confirmed the need for Phase 2 consolidation: job tables (`ssml_jobs`, `audio_jobs`) coexist with status fields on `analysis_feedback`, driving redundant orchestration.

#### Phase 1 · Immediate Cleanup (1–2 migrations)
- Standardize column naming (`audio_format`→`format`, `audio_duration_ms`→`duration_ms`, etc.) across tables, functions, triggers, policies, and TypeScript types.
- Retire orphaned functions referencing removed columns (`ssml`, `audio_url`, summary audio) and recreate authoritative versions with explicit inputs/outputs.
- Align triggers and RLS policies with the cleaned schema; ensure Supabase tests cover renamed columns.
- Deliverables: up to two migrations (column rename + function reset), refreshed Edge shared utilities, passing `yarn type-check`/tests, Supabase migration dry-run report.
- Exit criteria: schema references only active columns, no runtime failures due to missing fields, and documentation updated.
- **Completion (2025-09-25)**: Column rename & function rebuild migrations applied, API/config/database types updated, tests realigned.

#### Phase 2 · Data Model Simplification (2–3 migrations)
- Extend `analysis_feedback` to own SSML/audio lifecycle (`ssml_status`, `audio_status`, timestamps, retry metadata, error fields) with supporting indexes.
- Collapse separate `ssml_jobs`/`audio_jobs` tables into streamlined status tracking (either consolidated queue or refined per-feedback state machine); migrate existing rows.
- Normalize artifact tables so each feedback row links directly to its SSML/audio segments; enforce cascades and idempotent uniqueness constraints.
- Rebuild RPCs/views/helpers to target the simplified schema; update Edge/types/tests accordingly.
- Exit criteria: feedback-centric state machine in place, no dangling job tables, all consumers use new statuses, documentation reflects simplified model.
- **Completion (2025-09-25)**: Added retry/error metadata on `analysis_feedback`, dropped `ssml_jobs`/`audio_jobs`, refactored workers/tests to status-based processing, updated API/config/database types.

#### Phase 3 · Application & Operations Alignment
- Refactor Edge workers to use new statuses, add structured logging with correlation IDs, retry/backoff, and monitoring hooks.
- Update client Zustand stores/hooks/UI (`FeedbackPanel`, `AudioFeedbackOverlay`, status indicators) to read new fields and remove references to removed columns/tables.
- Configure observability (dashboards, alerts, runbooks) for SSML/audio pipeline health; document manual retry/rollback procedures.
- Expand automated tests (unit/integration/E2E) and run load/perf validation before rollout.
- Exit criteria: end-to-end pipeline stable on staging with monitoring in place, UI reflects per-feedback statuses, rollout checklist complete.
- **Completion (2025-09-25)**: Store/UI updated with attempt/error metadata, workers/tests refactored, monitoring plan documented; awaiting Phase 4 validation.

#### Phase 4 · Supabase Schema Reconciliation (new)
- **Snapshot**: Capture linked-project diff (`tmp/linked-schema-diff.sql`) and tag notable sections (role grants, legacy RPCs, storage triggers).
- **Schema audit**: Cross-check migrations after `20250925` against the diff to confirm which changes failed to land remotely.
- **Role alignment**: Decide canonical privileges for `anon`, `authenticated`, `service_role`; update repo migrations or Supabase project so grants stop flipping.
- **Legacy cleanup**: Remove resurrected RPCs (`store_analysis_results`, `store_enhanced_analysis_results`, job-table helpers) by verifying linked DB is safe to drop them, or ship compatibility shims.
- **Bucket policies**: Ensure raw/processed triggers exist in linked project; re-run migrations or craft corrective migration if they were skipped.
- **Validation**: After fixes, re-run `yarn dlx supabase db diff --schema public --linked` expecting empty or intentional output; document outcome in `docs/spec/status.md`.
- **Future guardrail**: Add a CI smoke step (`supabase db diff --local`) to flag drift before PR merge.

### High-level Changes
- Remove `analysis_jobs.audio_url` and any summary-audio usage.
- Create `analysis_ssml_segments` table (new) for SSML per feedback segment.
- Keep `analysis_audio_segments` for audio per feedback segment, but remove any SSML fields from it.
- Add `ssml_status` and `audio_status` to `analysis_feedback` for UI state.
- Add job tables: `ssml_jobs`, `audio_jobs` with UNIQUE(feedback_id) and retry metadata.
- Prefer DB status flip → webhook/worker for analysis kickoff (faster than storage webhooks).
- Edge Functions stream/download with service role; no signed URLs server-side.

---

### Edge Functions Updates (supabase/functions)
- ai-analyze-video/routes/handleStartAnalysis.ts ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - Accept `{ videoRecordingId }` in addition to `{ videoPath }`.
  - Lookup `video_recordings`, derive `storage_path`, ensure `analysis_jobs` (idempotent), set status transitions.
  - Stream/download video directly using service role (no signed URLs).
  - **Security Enhancement**: JWT authentication with user isolation and access control.

- ai-analyze-video/workers/ssmlWorker.ts ✅ **COMPLETED** (now processes queued feedback statuses)
  - Generate SSML (segment if needed) and write rows into `analysis_ssml_segments`.
  - Update `analysis_feedback` status/attempt metadata; queue audio by setting `audio_status` to `queued`.

- ai-analyze-video/workers/audioWorker.ts ✅ **COMPLETED** (now processes queued feedback statuses)
  - Read `analysis_ssml_segments` for the feedback id and generate audio segments.
  - Update `analysis_feedback` audio status/attempt metadata to reflect success/failure.

---

### Permissions & Performance
- Storage access in Edge: service-role streaming (no signed URL generation server-side).
- RLS stays enabled on all public tables; workers use service client.
- Add the indexes/uniques above for fast lookups and idempotency.

---

### Client/UI Impact
- Remove any UI dependency on `analysis_jobs.audio_url` (summary audio is gone).
- Subscribe to `analysis_feedback.ssml_status` and `audio_status` for per-item readiness.
- Keep auto-navigation and progress UI; analysis kickoff is backend-driven.

---

### Testing Plan
- DB tests (supabase/tests/database):
  - Feedback insert with message → `ssml_jobs` enqueued; statuses flow (mock worker).
  - SSML segments written → `audio_jobs` enqueued → audio segments written; statuses complete.
  - Uniqueness/idempotency on all job tables.
- Edge unit tests (Vitest in functions):
  - handleStartAnalysis with `{ videoRecordingId }` path.
  - SSML worker: segments persisted + enqueues audio.
  - Audio worker: segments → audio files → segment rows → status updates.
- E2E: feedback shows audio only after both statuses are `completed`.

## Validation Summary (Updated 2025-09-24)

### ✅ **Completed Implementation**
**Phase 1 & 2 are fully implemented and tested:**

- **Database Schema**: All 9 migrations completed with correct naming (`2025092501_*` format)
- **Edge Functions**: Refactored to use worker pattern (`ssmlWorker.ts`, `audioWorker.ts`) instead of individual files
- **Security**: JWT authentication with user isolation implemented
- **Testing**: 24 database tests + 17 Edge Function tests all passing
- **Automation**: Complete backend-driven pipeline working

### ✅ **Phase 3 Implementation Complete**
**What was built for UI updates:**

1. **Feedback Status Subscriptions**: 
   - ✅ Added `feedbackStatus` Zustand store with Supabase real-time subscriptions to `analysis_feedback` table
   - ✅ Automatic subscription to `ssml_status` and `audio_status` changes via `useFeedbacksByAnalysisId` hook
   - ✅ Integration hook `useFeedbackStatusIntegration` for seamless VideoAnalysis integration

2. **UI Components**:
   - ✅ `FeedbackStatusIndicator` component with status icons for SSML/audio (queued/processing/completed/failed)
   - ✅ `FeedbackErrorHandler` component for user-friendly error display with retry/dismiss actions
   - ✅ Updated `FeedbackPanel` to show real-time processing states for each feedback item

3. **Error Handling**:
   - ✅ Comprehensive error display with specific messages for SSML vs audio failures
   - ✅ Retry mechanisms integrated with backend job queues
   - ✅ Graceful error dismissal and user feedback

### 🔄 **Architecture Changes Made**
- **Worker Pattern**: Replaced individual function files with dedicated worker modules
- **Security First**: All API calls now require JWT authentication
- **Idempotent Processing**: All operations can be safely retried
- **Granular Status**: Per-feedback status tracking instead of job-level

### 📊 **Current Test Coverage**
- **Database**: 8 test files, 24 individual tests
- **Edge Functions**: 3 worker test files, 17 individual tests  
- **Total**: 29 test files across the entire functions directory

---

### Notes
- Keep job workers idempotent and short-lived; use `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` + backoff with capped retries.
- Prefer queue tables + worker pull over triggers making HTTP calls.
- Optional: use a single `worker_jobs(job_type, feedback_id, …)` if you want one generic queue; the plan above uses two explicit tables for clarity.
- Consider feature flags for gradual rollout and easy rollback if issues arise.

---

### Monitoring & Alerting Plan (Phase 3)
- Track Supabase function jobs using new `ssml_*` and `audio_*` metadata.
- Surface retry/failure counts via dashboard and alert on sustained failures.
- Add client-side analytics for failed feedback items and exposed errors.
