### Task 32: Storage Path Optimization - Database IDs + Date Partitioning — ✅ Complete (2025-10-21)
- Database migration: `storage_path` column added to `analysis_audio_segments` with index and comments
- Path helper functions: `getDateFolder()`, `buildVideoPath()`, `buildAudioPath()` with comprehensive test suite (13/13 tests)
- Video upload service: migrated to semantic paths using database ID + date partitioning
- Audio worker: updated to generate semantic paths grouped by video with proper context fetching
- Client-side audio service: prefers `storage_path` with fallback to `audio_url` for backward compatibility
- Path format: Videos `{user_id}/videos/{yyyymmdd}/{video_id}/video.{format}`, Audio `{user_id}/videos/{yyyymmdd}/{video_id}/audio/{feedback_id}/{segment_index}.{format}`
- Bucket architecture: Videos in `raw` bucket (private), audio in `processed` bucket (service-role only)
- Date partitioning: Uses `video_recordings.created_at` (UTC) for consistent organization across buckets
- Comprehensive documentation: `docs/architecture/storage-organization.md` with operational runbook
