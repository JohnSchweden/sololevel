### Task 11: Eliminate useFeedbackPanel Redundancy 
**Effort:** 2 hours | **Priority:** Medium | **Depends on:** Task 10

@step-by-step-rule.mdc - Evaluate and potentially remove useFeedbackPanel hook if it only wraps useState with no business logic.

OBJECTIVE: Reduce abstraction overhead by eliminating hooks that don't provide value beyond useState.

CURRENT STATE:
- packages/app/features/VideoAnalysis/hooks/useFeedbackPanel.ts (78 lines)
- Only manages: panelFraction, activeTab, selectedFeedbackId
- selectedFeedbackId now redundant with useFeedbackSelection.highlightedFeedbackId
- panelFraction/activeTab are simple UI state (expand/collapse, tab switching)

DECISION CRITERIA:
IF useFeedbackPanel only does:
  - useState wrappers
  - No coordination with other hooks
  - No complex business logic
THEN: Remove it, move state directly to VideoAnalysisScreen or FeedbackSection

IF it provides:
  - Animation coordination
  - Complex panel lifecycle management
  - Multi-component synchronization
THEN: Keep it but remove selectedFeedbackId (now redundant)

SCOPE:
- OPTION A (Most Likely): Remove hook entirely
  - DELETE: packages/app/features/VideoAnalysis/hooks/useFeedbackPanel.ts
  - DELETE: packages/app/features/VideoAnalysis/hooks/useFeedbackPanel.test.ts
  - MODIFY: VideoAnalysisScreen.tsx - Replace with useState for panelFraction/activeTab
  
- OPTION B: Keep but simplify
  - REMOVE: selectedFeedbackId from interface (now handled by useFeedbackSelection)
  - KEEP: panelFraction and activeTab management
  - UPDATE: Tests to remove selectedFeedbackId coverage

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- [ ] No redundant selectedFeedbackId state
- [ ] Panel expand/collapse still works
- [ ] Tab switching still works
- [ ] No loss of animation coordination (if Option B)
- [ ] VideoAnalysisScreen.tsx cleaner, not more complex
- [ ] All existing panel behavior preserved

SUCCESS VALIDATION:
- yarn type-check passes
- Panel expands/collapses smoothly
- Tab switching works
- No state synchronization bugs
