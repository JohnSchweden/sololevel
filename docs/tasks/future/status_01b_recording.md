# Project Status

## Completed Features
- Basic project setup
- Database connections
- Base module structure
- **Video Recording Core Infrastructure (US-RU-01)**
  - ✅ 60-second hard limit enforcement in `useRecordingStateMachine`
  - ✅ Recording state machine with IDLE/RECORDING/PAUSED/STOPPED states
  - ✅ Real-time timer with 100ms precision updates
  - ✅ Pause/Resume/Stop recording controls
  - ✅ Camera permissions handling (native & web)
  - ✅ Cross-platform camera preview (VisionCamera + Expo Camera fallback)
  - ✅ Recording controls UI components (`IdleControls`, `RecordingControls`)
  - ✅ Video upload service with Supabase Storage integration
  - ✅ Signed URL generation for secure uploads
  - ✅ Upload progress tracking and chunked uploads
  - ✅ Local video file storage via `expo-file-system` (VideoStorageService for camera recordings)

### **US-RU-06b: Recording states — Recording/Paused controls**
- ✅ **Implementation**: `packages/ui/src/components/CameraRecording/RecordingControls.tsx`
- ✅ **State Management**: `useRecordingStateMachine` with RECORDING/PAUSED state transitions
- ✅ **Timer Display**: Real-time formatted duration with 100ms precision updates
- ✅ **Primary Controls**: Pause/Resume toggle button and Stop button (44px+ touch targets)
- ✅ **Zoom Controls**: Fixed zoom levels (1x, 2x, 3x) with visual feedback
- ✅ **Camera Settings**: Settings button with sheet/modal support
- ✅ **Camera Swap**: Disabled during recording (canSwapCamera prop logic)
- ✅ **Touch Targets**: All controls meet 44px minimum requirement
- ✅ **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and accessibility roles implemented

### **US-RU-07: Confirm navigation away while recording**
- ✅ **Implementation**: `NavigationDialog` component with confirmation flow
- ✅ **State Detection**: `useCameraScreenLogic` detects RECORDING/PAUSED states
- ✅ **Dialog Logic**: Shows "Discard Recording?" with Cancel/Discard options
- ✅ **Integration**: Back button and navigation events trigger confirmation
- ✅ **Data Protection**: Recording stops and cleanup on discard confirmation

### **US-RU-08: Live motion capture overlay with nodes (recording)**
- ✅ **Implementation**: Cross-platform `PoseOverlay` component
- ✅ **Native Rendering**: Skia-based implementation (`PoseOverlay.native.tsx`)
- ✅ **Web Rendering**: WebGL-based implementation (`PoseOverlay.web.tsx`) 
- ✅ **Live Processing**: Real-time pose detection during recording
- ✅ **Visual Rendering**: Keypoints and skeleton connections with confidence-based styling
- ✅ **Non-blocking**: Overlay does not interfere with camera controls interaction
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized rendering with pose filtering and normalization

### **US-RU-09b: Camera controls — zoom & settings (recording)**
- ✅ **Implementation**: `ZoomControls` component with discrete levels
- ✅ **Zoom Levels**: Fixed 1x, 2x, 3x zoom with smooth transitions
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Active zoom level highlighting and press animations
- ✅ **Settings Integration**: Camera settings button integrated in control layout
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Zoom level announcements and button states
- ✅ **Touch UX**: Proper button sizing and press feedback

## In Progress
- **US-RU-01: Record a video up to 60 seconds** (85% complete)
  - ✅ Recording state machine with 60s hard limit
  - ✅ Recording controls (Record, Pause/Resume, Stop)
  - ✅ Real-time timer display during recording
  - ✅ Camera and microphone permissions
  - ✅ Local video file storage via `expo-file-system`
  - ✅ Supabase Storage upload with signed URLs
  - 🏗️ **Integration between recording hooks and upload service** (final step)
  - ⏳ Comprehensive error handling and user feedback for upload failures
  - ⏳ Video format validation and compression for AI processing
  - ⏳ Cross-platform verification (Expo native ↔ Next.js web)
  - ⏳ End-to-end integration testing

- **US-RU-09b: Camera controls — zoom & settings (recording)** (50% complete)
  - ✅ Zoom presets apply to camera (`setZoom`) on Expo/VisionCamera
  - ⏳ Camera Settings sheet content and wiring from controls button (flash, grid)
  - ⏳ `handleSettingsOpen` is a stub; `SideSheet` exists but is not connected to settings yet

- **US-RU-13: Video playback with live processing** (60% complete)
  - ✅ VideoPlayer implemented with loading and controls overlay (native & web)
  - ✅ Screen transition to VideoPlayer on stop using saved video URI
  - ✅ Controls overlay auto-hides on play; loading overlay shows during buffering
  - ✅ Real-time updates and WebSocket integration infrastructure ready
  - 🏗️ **Auto-start analysis on stop + realtime status overlay wiring**
  - ⏳ AI processing pipeline connection
  - ⏳ Processing status UI and error handling
  - ⏳ Automatic playback trigger after recording

**Current Focus: Recording → Upload → Processing Integration Pipeline**
- Status: Ready for final integration (90% infrastructure complete)

## Pending
- Integration testing for complete recording → upload → analysis workflow
- Performance optimization for live pose overlay during recording
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms for upload failures

## **Architecture Compliance Validation**
✅ **Cross-platform UI**: Tamagui tokens used throughout (`$space.md`, `$color10`, etc.)
✅ **Mobile-first Design**: All touch targets ≥44px, proper spacing and typography
✅ **Platform-specific Implementations**: `.native.tsx` and `.web.tsx` files used appropriately
✅ **State Management**: Zustand stores with proper TypeScript typing
✅ **Component Architecture**: Reusable UI components in `@my/ui` package
✅ **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, roles, and screen reader support

## Known Issues
- Web camera recording shows placeholder (expected - not supported in browsers)
- Upload integration needs final connection between recording hooks and upload service
- Live pose overlay performance could be optimized for longer recording sessions
