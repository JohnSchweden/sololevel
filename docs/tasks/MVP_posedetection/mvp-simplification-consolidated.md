## Success Criteria
- [ ] MVP pose detection functional on both web and native platforms
- [ ] Total development time under 3 hours as estimated
- [ ] Zero modifications needed to existing production-ready components
- [ ] All advanced features preserved and available for incremental upgrade
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility maintained (web MediaDevices + native VisionCamera)
- [ ] Simple pose detection toggle integrated with existing recording state machine
- [ ] Basic model selection and quality settings functional
- [ ] Clear migration path documented for upgrading to full features

## Platform Dependencies
- **Native**: VisionCamera integration for `useMVPPoseDetection.native.ts`
- **Web**: MediaDevices integration for `useMVPPoseDetection.web.ts`
- **Both**: All other MVP files work cross-platform using existing infrastructure

## Time Estimation
- **Phase 1 (MVP Layer)**: 1-2 hours (6 new files)
- **Phase 2 (Integration)**: 1 hour (testing with existing components)
- **Phase 3 (Documentation)**: 30 minutes (usage guides)
- **Total**: ~3 hours (validated estimate)

## Implementation Notes
- **Leverage Existing**: Maximum reuse of production-ready components and state management
- **Minimal Scope**: Only 6 new files needed for MVP functionality
- **Preserved Investment**: All advanced features remain untouched for future enhancement
- **Risk Mitigation**: Using validated components minimizes integration complexity
- **Incremental Upgrade**: Clear path from MVP to full production features

## What's Different from Advanced Implementation
- **Simplified Types**: Basic pose interfaces without advanced metrics
- **Basic Configuration**: Essential settings only (no presets, optimization profiles)
- **Simple State**: No complex performance monitoring, thermal management, battery optimization
- **Essential Hooks**: Core pose detection without advanced features
- **MVP-Focused**: Development-friendly with production upgrade path

## Development Strategy
1. **Start with Types**: Create MVPpose.ts with essential interfaces
2. **Build Hooks**: Implement simplified pose detection for both platforms
3. **Add Configuration**: Create basic MVP config with essential settings
4. **Test Integration**: Verify existing components work with MVP hooks
5. **Document Usage**: Create clear examples and migration guides
