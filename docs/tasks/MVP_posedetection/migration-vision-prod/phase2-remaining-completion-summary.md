  swapCamera,
  swapError,
  fadeAnim,
  scaleAnim,
} = useEnhancedCameraSwap({
  enableTransitions: true,
  enableZoomPreservation: true,
  enableThermalValidation: true,
});

// UI Integration
<CameraSwapButton
  currentCamera={currentCamera}
  isSwapping={isSwapping}
  canSwap={canSwapCamera()}
  onSwap={() => swapCamera()}
  swapError={swapError}
  fadeAnim={fadeAnim}
  scaleAnim={scaleAnim}
/>
```

### Cross-Platform State Sync

```

### Legacy Migration
```tsx
// Automatic migration detection and execution
if (needsMigration(legacyState)) {
  const result = await migrateLegacyCameraStore(legacyState);
  if (result.success) {
    // Apply migrated stores
    enhancedCameraStore.setState(result.migratedData.enhancedCameraStore);
    performanceStore.setState(result.migratedData.performanceStore);
    poseStore.setState(result.migratedData.poseStore);
