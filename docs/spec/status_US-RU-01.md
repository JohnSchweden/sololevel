# Project Status

## Completed Features
- Basic project setup
- Database connections
- Base module structure
- **Video Recording Core Infrastructure (US-RU-01)**
  - ✅ 60-second hard limit enforcement in `useRecordingStateMachine`
  - ✅ Recording state machine with IDLE/RECORDING/PAUSED/STOPPED states
  - ✅ Real-time timer with 100ms precision updates
  - ✅ Pause/Resume/Stop recording controls
  - ✅ Camera permissions handling (native & web)
  - ✅ Cross-platform camera preview (VisionCamera + Expo Camera fallback)
  - ✅ Recording controls UI components (`IdleControls`, `RecordingControls`)
  - ✅ Video upload service with Supabase Storage integration
  - ✅ Signed URL generation for secure uploads
  - ✅ Upload progress tracking and chunked uploads
  - ✅ Local video file storage via `expo-file-system` (VideoStorageService for camera recordings)
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for video recording components (Jest + React Native Testing Library)
- ✅ Integration tests for video storage → playback flow (VideoStorageService → VideoPlayer)
- ✅ Core video flow integration tests completed (8/8 tests passing)
- ✅ Video storage-playback integration tests fixed (9/9 tests passing)
- ✅ Enhanced debugging and error handling for video playback issues
- ✅ File path validation and permission checking in VideoStorageService
- ✅ Improved error logging in VideoPlayer with AVFoundation error details
- ✅ Path resolution debugging in CameraPreview components
- ✅ Test environment isolation for logging and file system operations
- ✅ **FIXED**: Video URI flow from camera recording to VideoPlayer
- ✅ **FIXED**: Real video URI now passed to VideoPlayer instead of fake generated URI
- ✅ **FIXED**: CameraPreview components now call `onVideoRecorded` callback with saved URI
- ✅ **FIXED**: Screen state transition properly handles real video URIs
- ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: Timing issue resolved - screen transition now waits for video saving to complete
- ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: Added ref-based URI tracking to prevent stale closure issues
- ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: VideoPlayer now receives correct saved video URI instead of fake generated URI

## In Progress
- **US-RU-01: Record a video up to 60 seconds** (85% complete)
  - ✅ Recording state machine with 60s hard limit
  - ✅ Recording controls (Record, Pause/Resume, Stop)
  - ✅ Real-time timer display during recording
  - ✅ Camera and microphone permissions
  - ✅ Local video file storage via `expo-file-system`
  - ✅ Supabase Storage upload with signed URLs
  - 🏗️ Integration between recording hooks and upload service
  - ⏳ Comprehensive error handling and user feedback for upload failures
  - ⏳ Video format validation and compression for AI processing
  - ⏳ Cross-platform verification (Expo native ↔ Next.js web)
  - ⏳ End-to-end integration testing

**Current Focus: Recording → Upload Integration**
- Status: In Progress (Starting implementation plan)

## Known Issues
- Web camera recording shows placeholder (expected - not supported in browsers)
- Upload integration needs completion between recording hooks and upload service
