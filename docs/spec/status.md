- Added typed helper `getFirstAudioUrlForFeedback` (RPC + fallback) with unit tests and structured logging.

  ### Authentication Implementation Details ✅

#### Core Authentication Infrastructure
- **Supabase Auth Client** (`packages/api/src/auth/authClient.ts`):
  - Typed wrapper around Supabase auth with error handling
  - Methods: `signInWithPassword`, `signOut`, `getSession`, `getCurrentUserId`, `onAuthStateChange`
  - Structured logging with email masking for privacy
  - Returns typed `AuthResult<T>` objects for consistent error handling

- **useAuth Hook** (`packages/app/hooks/useAuth.ts`):
  - React hook providing authentication state and actions
  - State: `user`, `session`, `loading`, `initialized`, `isAuthenticated`, `userId`
  - Actions: `signIn`, `signOut` with proper error handling
  - Automatic session restoration and auth state listeners

#### Route Protection System
- **Expo AuthGate** (`apps/expo/components/AuthGate.tsx`):
  - Client-side route protection for React Native
  - Loading states while auth initializes
  - Automatic redirect to sign-in with destination preservation

### Analysis Realtime Subscription Fixes ✅ Completed (2025-10-01)
- ✅ Fix duplicate subscriptions causing multiple realtime listeners (single subscription with cleanup)
- ✅ Add immediate backfill before subscribing to ensure job state is populated
- ✅ Implement effectiveAnalysisJobId propagation to downstream hooks
- ✅ Add channel lifecycle logging for better observability (SUBSCRIBED, payload events)
- ✅ Reduce render churn with guarded state updates
- ✅ **StrictMode resilience**: Pending-subscription guard blocks double-effect race
- ✅ **Channel error retry**: Bounded retry (3 attempts, 300-1200ms exponential backoff)
- ✅ **Backfill timing bridge**: 500ms re-check when BACKFILL_EMPTY to bridge upload→job gap
- ✅ **Log deduplication**: "Setting up..." logs only appear after passing subscription guards
- ✅ **Pending guard timing fix**: Clear pending key only on SUBSCRIBED status, not after storing subscription
- ✅ **Retry pending clear**: Clear pending key before retries to allow new subscription attempts
- ✅ **SQL query fix**: Removed `updated_at` from `analysis_feedback` query, added `created_at` ordering
- ✅ **Analysis UUID mapping**: Added `getAnalysisIdForJobId()` to map job IDs to feedback-compatible UUIDs
- ✅ **Feedback integration fix**: VideoAnalysisScreen now uses analysis UUIDs for feedback queries
- ✅ **UUID type error fix**: Resolved "invalid input syntax for type uuid" by using correct data types
- ✅ **Ownership filter fix**: `getAnalysisIdForJobId` now filters via `analysis_jobs.user_id`
- ✅ **Lint compliance**: Fixed all lint errors (Math.pow → **, parseInt → Number.parseInt, formatting)
- ✅ Unit tests created and passing for core functionality (12/12 tests passing)
- ✅ Extended analysisService.ts with diagnostics callbacks
- ✅ Fixed failing tests by correcting mock expectations and test patterns

## Feedback Realtime Subscription Collapse - COMPLETED (2025-10-02)
- **Root Cause**: Pogo-stick subscription behavior causing 10+ subscribe/unsubscribe cycles per analysis ID change
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive subscription guards and debouncing
- **Hook Guards**: Added `subscriptionStatus === 'pending'` check in `useFeedbackStatusIntegration` effect
- **Store Guards**: Strengthened store to prevent subscription when status is `active` OR `pending`
- **Debouncing**: Added 50ms debounce to prevent rapid re-subscription attempts
- **Retry Logic**: Enhanced retry mechanism with proper failure state transitions
- **Testing**: Created TDD test suite with failing tests, implemented fixes, verified passing tests
- **Result**: Single subscription per analysis ID, no pogo-stick behavior, stable realtime connections

## Analysis Realtime Subscription Polish - COMPLETED (2025-10-01)
**Status:** Completed
**Changes:**
- Throttled CHANNEL_ERROR logs from first occurrence (max 2 error logs, then suppressed)
- Added UUID retry logic with exponential backoff (200ms, 400ms, 800ms) to getAnalysisIdForJobId
- Added "Connection unstable" UI warning overlay when channel retries are exhausted
- Updated log messages for clarity ("No analysis UUID found after retries")
- Patched audio RPC fallback to use `feedback_id` column (legacy-compatible)
- Hardened feedback subscription hooks to dedupe subscriptions and remove duplicate keys
- Added bounded retry with backoff and failure state for feedback realtime subscriptions (no infinite loop)
**Impact:** Eliminates log spam, handles backend timing gaps gracefully, provides user feedback for connection issues

## In Progress




## Pending

- Variant B — Video Feedback refactor (2025-10-01): separate `useFeedbackSource` (DB/mock unified mapper + audio URL caching) and `useBubbleTimeline` (pure timeline engine). Maintain Variant A behavior, including the objective to begin video playback as soon as the first per‑feedback audio is available; never autoplay audio.

## Known Issues
- Web camera recording shows placeholder (expected - not supported in browsers)
- Upload integration needs final connection between recording hooks and upload service
- Live pose overlay performance could be optimized for longer recording sessions
- Type mismatches between state store and component interfaces
- Mock API services prevent full end-to-end functionality
- Video player resizing not implemented for bottom sheet expansion
- Limited real-time update mechanisms for live feedback
