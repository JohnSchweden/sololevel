  ### Authentication Implementation Details ✅

#### Core Authentication Infrastructure
- **Supabase Auth Client** (`packages/api/src/auth/authClient.ts`):
  - Typed wrapper around Supabase auth with error handling
  - Methods: `signInWithPassword`, `signOut`, `getSession`, `getCurrentUserId`, `onAuthStateChange`
  - Structured logging with email masking for privacy
  - Returns typed `AuthResult<T>` objects for consistent error handling

- **useAuth Hook** (`packages/app/hooks/useAuth.ts`):
  - React hook providing authentication state and actions
  - State: `user`, `session`, `loading`, `initialized`, `isAuthenticated`, `userId`
  - Actions: `signIn`, `signOut` with proper error handling
  - Automatic session restoration and auth state listeners

#### Route Protection System
- **Expo AuthGate** (`apps/expo/components/AuthGate.tsx`):
  - Client-side route protection for React Native
  - Loading states while auth initializes
  - Automatic redirect to sign-in with destination preservation
  - Configurable fallback components

- **Next.js Middleware** (`apps/next/middleware.ts`):
  - Server-side authentication validation
  - JWT token verification from cookies
  - Public route exclusions (auth pages, API, static assets)
  - Automatic redirect with intended destination preservation

- **Next.js AuthGate** (`apps/next/components/AuthGate.tsx`):
  - Client-side protection for web app
  - URL query parameter handling for post-auth redirects
  - Web-optimized loading states and layouts

#### Security Features
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Edge Functions extract user ID from JWT tokens
- **No Client Tampering**: User ID derived server-side, not from client requests
- **RLS Enforcement**: Database queries filtered by authenticated user ID
- **Access Control**: Users can only access their own video recordings
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging

#### Testing Infrastructure
- **Test Auth Bootstrap** (`packages/app/auth/testAuthBootstrap.ts`):
  - Environment-gated automatic authentication
  - Production build guards prevent test auth in production
  - Configurable via `TEST_AUTH_ENABLED`, `TEST_AUTH_EMAIL`, `TEST_AUTH_PASSWORD`
  - Correlation IDs for debugging and audit trails

#### Environment Configuration
- **Development** (`env.dev.example`): Test auth enabled by default
- **Production** (`env.prod.example`): Test auth explicitly disabled
- **General** (`env.example`): Test auth disabled with clear documentation

#### Cross-platform Compatibility
- **React Native** (Expo): AuthGate + useAuth integration
- **Web** (Next.js): Middleware + AuthGate dual protection
- **Universal Routing**: Works with Expo Router on both platforms
- **Session Synchronization**: Consistent auth state across platforms

## Script Infrastructure ✅ 100% Complete
  - **Centralized Environment Configuration** (`scripts/utils/env.mjs`): Shared environment loading, validation, and Supabase client creation
  - **Unified Logging System**: Structured logging with `createScriptLogger()` replacing console usage
  - **Authentication Helpers**: Common functions for user creation, verification, and sign-in testing
  - **Database Utilities**: Direct PostgreSQL client creation and connection management
  - **Environment Validation**: Automatic validation of required Supabase and test auth variables
  - **Legacy Script Cleanup**: Removed 15+ duplicate scripts with hard-coded credentials
  - **Smoke Testing Suite**: `smoke-login.mjs` and `smoke-user-check.mjs` for quick validation
  - **Smoke Test Utilities**: `smoke-utils.mjs` with lightweight shared functions using centralized `env.mjs` configuration
  - **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete usage guide in `docs/scripts/README.md`
  - **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with debug information and proper exit codes
  - **Cross-platform Support**: Works with local and remote Supabase instances

## Completed Features

### SSML/Audio Refactor Testing Pipeline ✅ 100% Complete
- **Migration Dry-run Validation**: Confirmed all status metadata and trigger changes applied successfully with "No schema changes found"
- **Edge Worker Unit Tests**: All 54 Deno tests passed (audioWorker: 5, ssmlWorker: 4, handleStartAnalysis: 8, plus comprehensive integration tests)
- **Status Model Validation**: Per-feedback SSML/audio processing with retry logic, status tracking (`ssml_status`, `audio_status`, attempts counters)
- **Database Trigger Testing**: `reset_feedback_generation_state` trigger properly resets processing state when feedback content changes
- **Worker Pipeline Testing**: Audio and SSML workers correctly process queued jobs with proper error handling and retry mechanisms

## In Progress



## Pending



## Known Issues
- Web camera recording shows placeholder (expected - not supported in browsers)
- Upload integration needs final connection between recording hooks and upload service
- Live pose overlay performance could be optimized for longer recording sessions
- Type mismatches between state store and component interfaces
- Mock API services prevent full end-to-end functionality
- Video player resizing not implemented for bottom sheet expansion
- Limited real-time update mechanisms for live feedback

## Recent Fixes ✅
- **Storage Trigger Issue**: Fixed `trg_finalize_video_on_raw_object` not firing by replacing temp upload + move workaround with direct signed URL upload to user-scoped paths. Both storage finalization and analysis job creation triggers now work correctly.
