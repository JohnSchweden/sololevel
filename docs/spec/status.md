## Dependencies Status
- âœ… Camera recording system completed
- ðŸŸ¡ AI analysis pipeline (backend pending - mock data available for UI development)
- ðŸŸ¡ Pose detection data (using mock data for UI development)

## Pending
- xxx

## Known Issues
- Web camera recording shows placeholder (expected - not supported in browsers)
- Upload integration needs final connection between recording hooks and upload service
- Live pose overlay performance could be optimized for longer recording sessions
