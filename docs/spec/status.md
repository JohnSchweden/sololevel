## COMPLETED

### Task 24: AudioFeedback Demotion — Presentation-Only, Lift Inactivity Up — ✅ Complete (2025-10-08)
- `AudioFeedback` now emits optional `onInactivity` without mutating visibility directly; timers skip when unused
- `useFeedbackCoordinator` handles inactivity to hide overlay/bubble together and clears playback selections
- Screen wiring forwards both `onClose` and `onInactivity`, unit tests updated for coordinator and section wiring

### Task 25: Screen Wiring Cleanup — Derive Overlay from Coordinator — ✅ Complete (2025-10-08)
- Removed duplicate overlay handlers from `VideoAnalysisScreen`; screen now purely wires coordinator state
- `coordinateFeedback.overlayVisible` drives overlay visibility exclusively; no custom lifecycle logic remains
- Verified `yarn type-check` passes and all visibility transitions happen via coordinator

### Task 23: Bubble Timer Realignment — ✅ Complete (2025-10-08)
- Updated `useBubbleController` to arm the hide timer on first confirmed playback (`isPlaying`/progress) instead of `showBubble`
- Added duration-aware rescheduling and immediate pause/end teardown to keep overlay and bubble in lockstep
- Expanded unit suite to cover playback start delays, late-arriving durations, pause/end sync; pending follow-up: seek interaction test
- Verified via `yarn workspace @my/app test features/VideoAnalysis/hooks/useBubbleController.test.ts --runTestsByPath`, `yarn type-check`, `yarn lint`

### Task 21: Audio/Overlay Orchestration — ✅ Complete (2025-10-07)
- Centralised overlay visibility logic inside `useFeedbackCoordinator` so bubble/overlay share lifecycle
- Screen now consumes coordinator `overlayVisible`; removed duplicate overlay computation
- Added coordinator reactions to align bubble visibility with audio start/pause/end states
- Fixed perpetual bubble loop caused by activeAudioId fallback; coordinator now only realigns when highlight exists
- Unit tests expanded to 10 cases covering overlay/bubble synchronization scenarios

### Task 22: Audio End-State Reliability — ✅ Complete (2025-10-07)
- Refactored `useAudioController.handleEnd` to read fresh refs for playback state and deterministically reset `isPlaying`
- Added regression tests covering near-zero end, unloaded end, and post-seek scenarios to prevent stale closure regressions
- Verified `yarn workspace @my/app test features/VideoAnalysis/hooks/useAudioController.test.ts --runTestsByPath` passes locally

## Agent Handoff Protocol

### When an agent completes a task:
1. Update this file with ✅ Complete status
2. Add completion timestamp
4. Wait for confirmation before ending session

### When an agent starts a task:
1. Verify all dependencies are complete
2. Update status to 🟡 In Progress
3. Begin work following @step-by-step-rule.mdc

### Status Legend:
- ⏸️ Waiting - Blocked by dependencies
- 🟡 In Progress - Currently working
- ✅ Complete - Finished successfully
- 🟢 Ready to Start - Dependencies met, ready for work
- ❌ Blocked - Has blockers/issues
- 🚫 Cancelled - Task cancelled
