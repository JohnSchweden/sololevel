## IN PROGRESS

### Navigation Header Alignment ‚Äî üü° In Progress (2025-10-10)
- Refactoring `AppHeader` to remain presentational while moving React Navigation wiring into `NavigationAppHeader`
- Added configurable actions/slots to preserve flexibility without bundling navigation logic inside UI package
- Pending validation: run `yarn type-check`, `yarn lint`, and targeted navigation tests once integration is finalized

## RECENT COMPLETION

### VideoAnalysisScreen Refactoring ‚Äî ‚úÖ Complete (2025-01-27)
- Successfully reduced VideoAnalysisScreen from 1,131 lines to 111 lines (90% reduction)
- Extracted 14 hooks into single orchestrator with clear separation of concerns
- Implemented platform-specific layouts (`.native.tsx` / `.web.tsx`) for clean separation
- Created comprehensive test coverage (32 new tests) with 1:50 test-to-code ratio
- Established reusable architecture patterns for future complex components
- Quality gates: `yarn type-check` ‚Üí 0 errors, `yarn lint` ‚Üí 0 errors, all tests passing
- Performance: No regressions in gesture response or animation smoothness
- Documentation: Feature README, architecture updates, and completion report created

## RECENT VERIFICATION

### Architectural Refactor Verification ‚Äî ‚úÖ Complete (2025-10-09)
- Moved hooks from `@my/api` to `@my/app` (useAnalysis, useUser, useVideoUpload, useMutationWithErrorHandling, useQueryWithErrorHandling)
- Updated imports across codebase to use new locations (`@app/hooks/*`)
- Fixed test mocks in `useAnalysisState.test.ts` to reference new hook locations
- Verified package exports are clean (API only exports services/types/utilities)
- Quality gates: `yarn type-check:all` ‚Üí 0 errors, `yarn lint:all` ‚Üí 0 errors (fixed 7 files), `yarn build` ‚Üí success
- Full test suite: 56 test suites passed, 619 tests passed (11 skipped)
- Architecture now correctly separates: API package (backend client) vs App package (business logic/hooks)

## COMPLETED

### Task 24: AudioFeedback Demotion ‚Äî Presentation-Only, Lift Inactivity Up ‚Äî ‚úÖ Complete (2025-10-08)
- `AudioFeedback` now emits optional `onInactivity` without mutating visibility directly; timers skip when unused
- `useFeedbackCoordinator` handles inactivity to hide overlay/bubble together and clears playback selections
- Screen wiring forwards both `onClose` and `onInactivity`, unit tests updated for coordinator and section wiring

### Task 25: Screen Wiring Cleanup ‚Äî Derive Overlay from Coordinator ‚Äî ‚úÖ Complete (2025-10-08)
- Removed duplicate overlay handlers from `VideoAnalysisScreen`; screen now purely wires coordinator state
- `coordinateFeedback.overlayVisible` drives overlay visibility exclusively; no custom lifecycle logic remains
- Verified `yarn type-check` passes and all visibility transitions happen via coordinator

### Task 23: Bubble Timer Realignment ‚Äî ‚úÖ Complete (2025-10-08)
- Updated `useBubbleController` to arm the hide timer on first confirmed playback (`isPlaying`/progress) instead of `showBubble`
- Added duration-aware rescheduling and immediate pause/end teardown to keep overlay and bubble in lockstep
- Expanded unit suite to cover playback start delays, late-arriving durations, pause/end sync; pending follow-up: seek interaction test
- Verified via `yarn workspace @my/app test features/VideoAnalysis/hooks/useBubbleController.test.ts --runTestsByPath`, `yarn type-check`, `yarn lint`

### Task 21: Audio/Overlay Orchestration ‚Äî ‚úÖ Complete (2025-10-07)
- Centralised overlay visibility logic inside `useFeedbackCoordinator` so bubble/overlay share lifecycle
- Screen now consumes coordinator `overlayVisible`; removed duplicate overlay computation
- Added coordinator reactions to align bubble visibility with audio start/pause/end states
- Fixed perpetual bubble loop caused by activeAudioId fallback; coordinator now only realigns when highlight exists
- Unit tests expanded to 10 cases covering overlay/bubble synchronization scenarios

### Task 22: Audio End-State Reliability ‚Äî ‚úÖ Complete (2025-10-07)
- Refactored `useAudioController.handleEnd` to read fresh refs for playback state and deterministically reset `isPlaying`
- Added regression tests covering near-zero end, unloaded end, and post-seek scenarios to prevent stale closure regressions
- Verified `yarn workspace @my/app test features/VideoAnalysis/hooks/useAudioController.test.ts --runTestsByPath` passes locally

## Agent Handoff Protocol

### When an agent completes a task:
1. Update this file with ‚úÖ Complete status
2. Add completion timestamp
4. Wait for confirmation before ending session

### When an agent starts a task:
1. Verify all dependencies are complete
2. Update status to üü° In Progress
3. Begin work following @step-by-step-rule.mdc

### Status Legend:
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Waiting - Blocked by dependencies
- üü° In Progress - Currently working
- ‚úÖ Complete - Finished successfully
- üü¢ Ready to Start - Dependencies met, ready for work
- ‚ùå Blocked - Has blockers/issues
- üö´ Cancelled - Task cancelled
