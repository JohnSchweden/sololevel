## In Progress


## Pending




## Known Issues
- Web camera recording shows placeholder (expected - not supported in browsers)
- Upload integration needs final connection between recording hooks and upload service
- Live pose overlay performance could be optimized for longer recording sessions
- **RESOLVED**: All tests now passing - analysis service test fixed by removing @my/ui dependency and using local logger
