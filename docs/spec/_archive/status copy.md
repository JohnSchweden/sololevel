## In Progress






## Pending

# Validation Findings (Updated 2025-09-16)

### **US-VF-01: Video Analysis State Management** ✅ 85% Complete
**Status**: Ready for refinement
**Issues Found**:
- Type mismatch: Store uses `PoseFrame[]` but VideoPlayer expects `PoseData[]`
- Missing subscription mechanism for real-time pose data updates
- Audio-related state mixed with core video analysis state (should be separated)

**Next Steps**:
- Align pose data types between store and components
- Add proper subscription mechanism for real-time updates
- Separate audio feedback state from core video analysis state

### **US-VF-02: Video Player Component** ✅ 75% Complete
**Status**: Functional but needs performance optimization
**Issues Found**:
- No explicit 60fps optimization code visible
- Limited accessibility support (keyboard navigation, touch gestures)
- Loading states present but error handling could be more robust
- Type mismatch with pose data (see US-VF-01)

**Next Steps**:
- Add performance optimizations for smooth 60fps playback
- Enhance accessibility with full keyboard/web and touch/native support
- Improve error handling with more specific error types

### **US-VF-04: Feedback Bubble Component** ✅ 80% Complete
**Status**: Core functionality working
**Issues Found**:
- Limits to 3 visible messages (may hide important feedback)
- No explicit real-time update mechanism visible
- Acceptance criteria mentions "audio feedback" but component is for text bubbles

**Next Steps**:
- Consider showing more than 3 messages with better prioritization
- Add explicit real-time update mechanism for live feedback
- Clarify relationship between text and audio feedback

### **US-VF-06: Video Controls Component** ✅ 90% Complete
**Status**: Nearly complete
**Issues Found**:
- Header visibility sync not explicitly implemented in this component

**Next Steps**:
- Ensure proper sync between header and controls visibility
- Enhance progress bar scrubbing for better user experience

### **US-VF-07: Audio Commentary Component** ⚠️ 60% Complete
**Status**: UI complete, integration missing
**Issues Found**:
- No actual audio playback implementation (expects parent to handle)
- Video pause/resume logic not implemented in this component
- Missing TTS audio streaming functionality

**Next Steps**:
- Implement actual audio playback (react-native-sound or react-native-video)
- Add video pause/resume logic when audio feedback plays
- Integrate with TTS pipeline for real audio generation

### **US-VF-08: Feedback Panel Component** ✅ 85% Complete
**Status**: Core functionality present

**Status**: Basic integration working
**Issues Found**:
- Uses mock API services (getAnalysisJob, getAnalysisResults)
- Limited error handling across component integration
- Props may not be properly typed/passed from routing

**Next Steps**:
- Replace mock APIs with real Supabase integration
- Add comprehensive error handling for integration points
- Ensure proper prop passing from Expo Router navigation

### **US-VF-10: Coach Avatar Component** ✅ 70% Complete
**Status**: Functional but basic
**Issues Found**:
- No animations implemented (breathing effect mentioned as optional)
- Speaking state tracked but not visually indicated

**Next Steps**:
- Add subtle animations for better user experience
- Implement visual speaking indicators
- Consider more engaging avatar design

### **Backend Integration & API Services**
- Replace mock APIs with real Supabase Edge Functions
- Implement proper data flow between components
- Add comprehensive error handling and loading states

### **Performance Optimization**
- Implement 60fps video playback optimization
- Add pose data processing optimization
- Optimize component re-rendering and memory usage

### **Accessibility & UX Polish**
- Complete WCAG 2.2 AA compliance across all components
- Add full keyboard navigation support
- Enhance touch gesture support for native

### **Missing Components**
- Motion Capture Overlay (US-VF-03) - referenced but not fully implemented
- Video Title Component (US-VF-05) - referenced but not integrated

### **Advanced Features**
- Real-time pose detection integration with MoveNet
- AI feedback generation pipeline
- TTS audio generation and playback

### **Cross-platform Testing**
- Comprehensive testing across iOS, Android, and web platforms
- Performance testing under various network conditions

## Known Issues
- Web camera recording shows placeholder (expected - not supported in browsers)
- Upload integration needs final connection between recording hooks and upload service
- Live pose overlay performance could be optimized for longer recording sessions
- Type mismatches between state store and component interfaces
- Mock API services prevent full end-to-end functionality
- Video player resizing not implemented for bottom sheet expansion
- Limited real-time update mechanisms for live feedback
