I want the user to be able to select on first login (having to see a screen before camerscreen only on first login) and to be able to select the voice of tone in which they will receive the feedback. There will be the decision basically. They can choose between male and female voice and between three different modes:
1. "Roast:Me"
2. "Zen:Me"
3. "Lovebomb:Me"  
 the "Roast me" mode should be the first one preselected. And the voice should be female first and also preselected and marked as star humoristic.

      When the user selects this mode and the voice, after the first video is analyzed, the analyzers in the back should use exactly this prompt for the feedback creation. This means the mode needs to be injected into LLM feedback creation, and the voice of tone needs to be injected into TTS voice creation output.

Also based on the selected gender and on the selected voice, I want to show in the video analysis in full screen mode the coach avatar specifically to this mode.

Also after the user selected this mode, I want them to be able to change this mode, and for this, they go into settings-personalisation. In personalisation, they should be able to change the gender and the mode. place those at the top.

Consider how I also need to extend my database tables, prompt templates and inputs based on the gender and mode.

search for other possible touchpoints and issues.

make sure that in history mode the user sees the correct coach avatar that was used when analyzed.
