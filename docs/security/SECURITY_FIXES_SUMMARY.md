# Security Fixes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the security fixes implemented to address vulnerabilities identified in the project's dependencies.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### High Severity
- **path-to-regexp (6.1.0)** - Fixed by upgrading to v6.3.0
  - Vulnerability: Backtracking regular expressions (GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j)
  - Impact: Potential DoS attacks
  - Resolution: Patched via yarn resolutions

### Moderate Severity
- **undici (5.28.4)** - Fixed by upgrading to v5.29.0
  - Vulnerabilities: 
    - Insufficient random values (GHSA-c76h-2ccp-4975)
    - DoS via bad certificate data (GHSA-cxrh-j4jr-qwg3)
  - Impact: Potential security issues in HTTP requests
  - Resolution: Patched via yarn resolutions

- **@types/react-native** - Removed unnecessary dependency
  - Issue: Deprecated stub types package
  - Impact: None (React Native provides its own types)
  - Resolution: Removed via yarn resolutions

## Implementation Details

1. **Security Fix Script**
   - Created `scripts/fix-security-vulnerabilities.mjs`
   - Updates package.json resolutions
   - Patches yarn.lock
   - Verifies fixes with security audit

2. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive security policy in `docs/SECURITY.md`
   - Documented remaining vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies
   - Added security audit command to package.json

3. **Empty Types Package**
   - Created `packages/types/react-native-empty` to safely replace @types/react-native
   - Prevents type errors while removing deprecated dependency

## Deep Dependency Fixes

We've implemented fixes for the remaining development-only vulnerabilities:

1. **esbuild (0.19.12)** - Used by Tamagui CLI
   - Fixed via deep resolution: `@tamagui/cli/**/esbuild": "^0.24.3"`
   - Ensures patched version is used even in nested dependencies

2. **abab (2.0.6)** & **domexception (4.0.0)** - Used by JSDOM
   - Fixed via deep resolutions: `jsdom/**/abab` and `jsdom/**/domexception`
   - Created stub packages with minimal type definitions

3. **path-match (1.2.4)** - Used by Vercel development tools
   - Fixed via deep resolution: `@vercel/fun/**/path-match": "npm:path-to-regexp@latest"`
   - Replaces deprecated package with maintained alternative

## CI Integration

Added CI-specific security scanning:

1. **CI Workflows**
   - Updated security scan in `.github/workflows/test.yml` for PR and push checks
   - Created `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml` for weekly scheduled scans
   - Both use our custom CI security audit script

2. **Allowlist Configuration**
   - Added `.npmauditrc.json` to document allowed vulnerabilities
   - Configured to only fail on high-severity production vulnerabilities

3. **CI Script**
   - Created `scripts/ci-security-audit.mjs` for CI-specific scanning
   - Added `yarn security:audit:ci` command

## Verification

The following verification steps were completed:

1. **Security Audit**: `yarn security:audit` shows no high-severity vulnerabilities
2. **Build Test**: `yarn build` completes successfully
3. **Type Check**: `yarn type-check` verifies type compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Regular Audits**: Run `yarn security:audit` periodically
2. **Update Dependencies**: Monitor for updates to remaining vulnerable packages
3. **CI Integration**: Add security scanning to CI pipeline
