# Wireframe-to-Screen Analyzer

## ðŸŽ¯ Complete Step-by-Step Custom Mode

This document provides the comprehensive description for analyzing wireframes for production-ready cross-platform Tamagui screens.

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 1: Initial Wireframe Analysis

### Command 1A: Generate Comprehensive Analysis

```bash
# Command to start wireframe analysis:
"
This is your current result of the @enhanced-camera.tsx  on expo go app.
Analyze and map the the visual elements, design, and layout with the underlying code. 
Describe the used components, themes, thokens, and properties.





This is a picture @goaldesign.png  of how the visual elements, design, and layout must look like.
Analyze and map the the visual elements, design, and layout with the previous description, code, and @currentdesign.png .
Identify the differences for the components, themes, thokens, and properties that must be done in currentdesign to match 1:1 the goaldesign.





Analyze, identify, and map how the visual elements, design, and layout must look like using this screenshot of the Figma app's frame Home over MCP, (@https://www.figma.com/design/MPEnw4iNogviVsnh7SUFy8/SoloLeveling?node-id=12-141&t=LW2fnYaz6nnqOwY2-4 )
Identify the differences for the components, themes, thokens, and properties that must be done. 
Adjut the [EnhancedCameraRecording] screen efficiently. 
The design must precisely replicate every detail in the screenshot, down to the last pixel. 
Ensure all fonts, colors, spacing, alignments, and components match exactly as shown. 
Implement responsive layouts where necessary to maintain fidelity across devices. 
Aim for a pixel-perfect implementation.

### Command 1B: Validate Analysis Against User Stories and Wireframes

```bash
"
Validate generated task list docs/features/[feature-name]/tasks.md against analysis:

1. Ensure all wireframe elements from analysis are covered in tasks
2. Verify technical requirements are addressed in implementation phases
3. Confirm cross-platform considerations are included
4. Check that mobile-first approach is reflected in task ordering
5. Validate testing pipeline covers all analysis requirements

Reference: docs/features/[feature-name]/analysis.md for validation.
