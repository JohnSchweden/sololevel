# Code Review System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive, modern code review system has been implemented for the Solo:Level AI Feedback Coach App, following industry best practices and tailored to the project's specific architecture and requirements.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. Automated Review Script (`scripts/ops/code-review.mjs`)
- **Language**: Node.js ES modules
- **Features**: 
  - Multiple review modes (quick, full, security, performance, architecture, pre-commit, CI)
  - Comprehensive quality checks
  - Colored terminal output
  - Detailed reporting
  - Configurable timeouts
  - Exit codes for CI integration

#### 2. Review Guidelines (`scripts/ops/code-review-guidelines.md`)
- **Comprehensive manual review checklist**
- **Security best practices**
- **Performance considerations**
- **Architecture compliance**
- **Cross-platform compatibility**
- **Testing requirements**

#### 3. Documentation (`scripts/ops/README.md`)
- **Quick start guide**
- **Feature overview**
- **Integration instructions**
- **Troubleshooting guide**

### Review Modes

| Mode | Duration | Checks | Use Case |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| `quick` | ~30s | Lint, TypeScript, Critical Tests, Git Hooks | Pre-commit |
| `full` | ~5m | All quality checks | Pull Request |
| `security` | ~2m | Security audit, patterns, type checking | Security review |
| `performance` | ~3m | Bundle analysis, build metrics | Performance review |
| `architecture` | ~1m | Monorepo structure, imports | Architecture review |
| `pre-commit` | ~1m | Essential checks only | Git hooks |
| `ci` | ~10m | Full validation suite | CI/CD pipeline |

### Quality Checks

#### Automated Checks
- **Linting**: Biome code quality and formatting
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript compilation and type checking
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and critical test execution
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning and security pattern detection
- **Performance**: Bundle analysis and performance metrics
- **Architecture**: Monorepo structure and import boundary validation
- **Documentation**: Code documentation completeness checks

#### Security Patterns
- Environment variable exposure
- Console log statements
- TODO/FIXME comments
- Hardcoded secrets detection

#### Architecture Validation
- Import boundary compliance
- Package dependency structure
- Monorepo organization
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Integration Points

#### Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "code-review": "node scripts/ops/code-review.mjs",
  "code-review:quick": "node scripts/ops/code-review.mjs --quick",
  "code-review:security": "node scripts/ops/code-review.mjs --security",
  "code-review:performance": "node scripts/ops/code-review.mjs --performance",
  "code-review:architecture": "node scripts/ops/code-review.mjs --architecture",
  "code-review:pre-commit": "node scripts/ops/code-review.mjs --pre-commit",
  "code-review:ci": "node scripts/ops/code-review.mjs --ci"
}
```

#### Exit Codes
- `0`: All checks passed
- `1`: Failed checks detected (action required)
- `2`: Warnings detected (review recommended)

### Project-Specific Adaptations

#### Solo:Level Architecture Compliance
- **Monorepo structure**: Validates `@my/ui`, `@my/app`, `@my/api`, `@my/config` boundaries
- **Cross-platform**: Ensures React Native (Expo) and Web (Expo Router) compatibility
- **AI Pipeline**: Validates pose detection, video analysis, and TTS integration
- **Authentication**: Checks JWT handling, RLS policies, and security patterns
- **Tamagui**: Ensures proper cross-platform styling usage

#### Technology Stack Integration
- **Yarn 4**: Workspace management and dependency validation
- **Biome**: Linting and formatting rules
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking across all packages
- **Turbo**: Build system integration
- **Supabase**: Backend security and RLS validation

### Usage Examples

#### Pre-commit Hook
```bash
#!/bin/sh
yarn code-review:pre-commit
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
- name: Code Review
  run: yarn code-review:ci
```

#### Manual Review
```bash
# Full review for pull requests
yarn code-review

# Quick check before committing
yarn code-review:quick

# Security-focused review
yarn code-review:security
```
