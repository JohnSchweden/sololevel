# Standardized Wireframe Analysis Workflow Commands

## üéØ Copy-Paste Commands for Each Phase

These standardized commands ensure consistent application of the
wireframe-to-screen workflow with proper .cursor/ rule integration.

## üìã Phase 1: Initial Wireframe Analysis

### Command 1A: Start New Wireframe Analysis

"New wireframe received for [FeatureName]. Before implementation:

1. Create feature directory: mkdir -p docs/features/[feature-name]/{components,testing}
2. Save wireframe image as: docs/features/[feature-name]/wireframe.png
3. Create analysis using template: cp docs/templates/analysis-template.md docs/features/[feature-name]/analysis.md  
3. Apply mobile-screen-patterns.mdc rules during responsive analysis
4. Use wireframe-to-code.mdc for systematic component mapping
5. Reference ui-styling-tamagui.mdc for Tamagui component decisions
6. Validate all technical requirements before task generation

Only proceed to task generation after analysis is complete and all sections checked off."
```
