## Implementation Notes
- **Analysis Reference**: Always validate implementation against docs/features/user-profile/analysis.md
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Design for smallest screen first, expand to larger screens
- **Device Testing**: Test on actual devices, not just simulators
- **Offline Considerations**: Consider offline functionality for mobile users
- **One-Handed Usage**: Optimize for one-handed mobile usage patterns
- **Cross-Platform Validation**: Ensure feature parity while respecting platform conventions

## Analysis Integration
- Reference wireframe analysis for component mapping decisions
- Validate technical requirements against analysis documentation
- Update analysis file if requirements change during implementation
- Use analysis as source of truth for acceptance criteria validation
