 * Detox E2E Test: Video Upload Pipeline

 * 1. App launches and camera permissions granted
 * 2. Upload button tapped → video file picker opens
 * 3. Video file selected from device
 * 4. Upload progresses and completes
 * 5. Database record created with correct status
 * 6. Navigation to video analysis screen
